#############################  Exclusions  ##########################

# Exclude URLs from checking (supports regex)

# balena base images account for ~1400 request to GitHub, they are
# omitted to avoid being rate limited.
# See https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting
# The openvpn link is omitted as trying to auto chek it results in
# a 503, even when it is available.
# The meta-balena link is included in parameterized scripts and as
# a result will always produce a failing link.
# The myorg/myapp link is a dummy address used in an example contract so is omitted.
# The balena/resin API urls will not respond to unauthenticated requests
# The gstatic and googleapis links go 404 and are excluded ever since we started checking HTML
# balenaCLI linux binary URLs always error out since they are generated on run time only
# File URLs are excluded as they aren't checked properly and error out
