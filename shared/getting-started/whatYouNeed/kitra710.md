* [A Kitra710][kitra710-link] product accelerator development board from [RushUp](http://www.rushup.tech/).
* A 12VDC power supply (100-240V input) with a 5mm DC barrel jack connector.
* At least one of Wireless communication antennas, the kit should container both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz antennas.
* **[optional]** Ethernet cable, if you prefer to **not** connect over wifi.
* A 4GB or larger SD card to create a boot disk. The [speed class][sdSpeed] of the card is important, a class 10 card or above is the way to go.
* **[optional]** It's also handy to have a tooth pick or small screw driver to set the tiny boot switches, but you will figure that out later in the guide :)
