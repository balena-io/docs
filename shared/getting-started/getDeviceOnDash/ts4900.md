Put the SD card into your device, and connect either the ethernet cable or WiFi adapter. At this point you need to make sure that your device will boot from the SD. This can be achived by enabling the SD-boot jumper present on most of the base boards.

For example, this is the TS-8550 base board. You can find the SD-boot jumper highlighted in the picture below:

Please ensure that this jumper is enabled before you provision and power up your device.

While you wait, {{ $names.company.lower }} is partitioning your internal memory, installing a custom linux environment and establishing a secure connection with our servers.

After roughly 5-7 minutes (depending on your SD card speed) your board will shut down. Disable the SD-boot jumper that mentioned above (and pull out the SD card if you wish).

Power up your board, and you should see the device in your dashboard shortly.

__Note:__ If you have an HDMI screen attached, you should see `"Booted - Check your {{ $names.company.lower }} dashboard."` on the screen when the device boots. If instead you see rainbow colors or a blank screen, it could mean that the SD card was not burned correctly or is corrupted. Try burning the SD card again.
