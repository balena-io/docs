Insert the SD card into your **{{ $device.name }}** and connect the ethernet cable if necessary. Now power up the **{{ $device.name }}** by inserting the micro USB cable.

It will take a minute or so for the **{{ $device.name }}** to appear on your {{ $names.company.lower }} [dashboard][dashboard]. While you wait, {{ $names.os.lower }} is expanding the partitions on your SD card to use all available space, installing a custom Linux environment, and establishing a secure connection with the {{ $names.company.lower }} servers.

You should now be ready to deploy some code!

__Note:__ Class 4 SD cards can take up to 3 times longer so it's well worth investing in the fastest card you can find.

##### Help! My device won't show up.
If your device still hasn't shown up on your dashboard after a few minutes, something is definitely wrong. First check that you entered the WiFi credentials correctly and ensure that your network meets these [basic requirements][networkRequirements]. It may also be worth checking the [LED error notifications][errorNotifications]

If you still can't get your device online, come on over and talk to us on our [support channel][usingSupport].
