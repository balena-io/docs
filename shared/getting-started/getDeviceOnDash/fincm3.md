The next step is to flash the downloaded image onto your {{ $device.name }}'s internal eMMC. The easiest way to flash the image onto the device is using {{ $names.company.lower }}’s [Etcher](https://etcher.io). Support for the CM3L is available on Etcher starting from version 1.2.1 for OSX and Windows (Windows still needs the Raspberry Pi Foundation [usbboot drivers](https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/blob/master/win32/rpiboot_setup.exe) installed).

The Raspberry Pi Foundation provides a tool that allows the Compute Module to expose the eMMC as a mass storage device that can be flashed like any other media. If you want to use the tool provided by the Raspberry Pi Foundation instead, please follow their instructions [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/computemodule/cm-emmc-flashing.md).

Once you have everything set up, run Etcher on your computer, connect your balena Fin via CM3L Debug (see USB_DBG on Image 1) and power it (see BARREL_JACK on Image 1). 

After a couple of seconds, the balena Fin eMMC should be detected on your computer by Etcher, which will initialize and list the board as a Compute Module based device (naming might change in the future). Select the downloaded image and press the “Flash!” button.

After flash is complete, power off your balena Fin and unplug the DEBUG micro-USB cable. Powering the balena Fin on will now result in the device booting from the freshly-written eMMC.

__Note:__ You can flash several {{ $device.name }}s with the same OS image file and all the devices will boot and provision into your application's fleet. You can also disable the auto-ejecting or validation steps from the **Etcher** settings panel.
