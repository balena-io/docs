[Repository]({{ $links.githubMain }}-playground/i2c-nodejs)

This is a simple node.js project that uses [i2c-bus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i2c-bus) to get data from a [VLNC4000 proximity & light sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/products/466). It is made to be generic and act as base for any i2c sensor integration. It should work on any of the {{ $names.company.lower }} supported devices, you just need to make sure i2c is enabled in the kernel and know the i2c bus number for you device.
