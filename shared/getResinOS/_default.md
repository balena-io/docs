To connect with resin.io, your **{{ $device.name }}** will need a resinOS image that is configured for your application and your network. Start by clicking *Add device* in your application dashboard:

<img src="/img/common/app/add_device.png" width="100%">

A list of available resinOS versions is shown in the dropdown. In general, the most recent version is recommend. You can also select whether you would prefer a *Development* or *Production* edition with a toggle:

<img src="/img/common/app/version.png" width="60%">

__Note:__ When you're first getting started, a Development image will be most useful, as it permits a number of testing and troubleshooting features. For production use, be sure to switch to a Production image. More details on the differences between Development and Production images can be found [here][devvprod].
