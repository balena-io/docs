* [**Samsung ARTIK 520**][artik5-spec-link] module mounted on a development board. We recommended either version 3.0-3.3 or version 0.5.
* A 5VDC power supply (100-240V input), if you purchased the development kit you should have one included.
* At least one of Wireless communication antennas, also provided as part of the development kit.
* **[optional]** Ethernet cable, if you prefer to **not** connect over wifi.
* A 4GB or larger SD card. The [speed class][sdSpeed] of the card also matters - class 10 card or above is the way to go.
* **[optional]** A tooth pick or small screw driver to set the boot switches.
