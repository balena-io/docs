* [A Kitra 520][kitra520-link] product accelerator development board from [RushUp](http://www.rushup.tech/).
* At least one wireless antenna (included in the kit).
* [Samsung ARTIK 520][artik5-eval-link] development carrier board. We recommended either version 3.0-3.3 or version 0.5. This development carrier board is required only for flashing the ARTIK 520 module. The Kitra 520 carrier board offers only Fastboot flashing, which is currently unsupported on resin.io.
* A 4GB or larger SD card to create a boot disk. The [speed class][sdSpeed] of the card is important—a class 10 card or above is the way to go.
* A micro USB cable.
* **[Optional]** A [2A+ micro USB 5V power supply][psu]
* **[Optional]** Ethernet cable, if you prefer to **not** connect over wifi during provisioning.
* **[Optional]** A tooth pick or small screw driver to set the tiny boot switches on the development board.
