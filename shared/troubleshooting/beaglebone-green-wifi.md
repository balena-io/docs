### Facing issues with Wifi connectivity

Always run the board from 5VDC 1A minimum supply when using a WiFi Dongle. You may need to use a extension cable to move the dongle away from the planes of the PCB. We also have had instances where when placed in a metal case, there can be WiFi issues as well. It will also help to use a dongle with a real antenna on it.
