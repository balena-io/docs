# ts4900



* A [TS-4900](https://www.embeddedarm.com/products/board-detail.php?product=TS-4900).
* A 4GB or larger SD card. The [TS-4900](https://www.embeddedarm.com/products/board-detail.php?product=TS-4900) uses a microSD card. The [speed class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sd_card#Speed_class_rating) of the card also matters - this determines its maximum transfer rate. We strongly recommend you get hold of a class 10 card or above.
* An ethernet cable or WiFi adapter to connect your device to the internet. The internal WiFi on the TS-4900 is unstable at the moment, so for the time being, it is recommended that you connect via ethernet.
