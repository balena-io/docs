* An [Odroid XU4](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-xu4-special-price/) Cortex-A7 quad core from [Hardkernel](https://www.hardkernel.com/) (the same process will work for the older [Odroid XU3](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-xu3/)).
* A 4GB or larger SD card. The [Odroid XU4](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-xu4-special-price/) uses a microSD card. The [speed class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sd_card#Speed_class_rating) of the card also matters - this determines its maximum transfer rate. We strongly recommend you get hold of a class 10 card or above.
* A 5V, 4 Amp power supply unit from [Hardkernel](https://www.hardkernel.com/) like this [one](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/5v-4a-power-supply-us-plug-2/).
* An ethernet cable or WiFi adapter to connect your device to the internet.
* A [{{ $names.company.lower }} account](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/signup).
