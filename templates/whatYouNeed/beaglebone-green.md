* A [Beaglebone Black](https://www.beagleboard.org/boards/beaglebone-black) or [Beaglebone Green](https://www.beagleboard.org/boards/seeedstudio-beaglebone-green).
* A 4GB or larger SD card. Both the Beaglebone Black and Green use a Micro SD card. The [speed class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital#Speed_class_rating) of the card also matters - this determines its maximum transfer rate. We strongly recommend you get hold of a class 10 card or above.
* An ethernet cable or [WiFi adapter](../../hardware/wifi-dongles/) to connect your device to the internet. The WiFi adapter for the Beaglebone Black is known to be unstable at moment, it is recommended that you use a usb WiFi adapter with a large external antenna.
* A mini USB cable the Beaglebone Black **OR** a micro USB cable for the Green.
* **\[Optional]** A 5VDC 1A power supply unit for the Beaglebone Black.
* A [\{{ $names.company.lower \}} account](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/signup).

**Note:** Always run the board from 5VDC 1A minimum supply when using a WiFi Dongle. You may need to use a extension cable to move the dongle away from the planes of the PCB. We also have had instances where when placed in a metal case, there can be WiFi issues as well. It will also help to use a dongle with a real antenna on it.
