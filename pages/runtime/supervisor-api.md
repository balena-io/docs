# Interacting with the Resin Supervisor

The Resin Supervisor is resin.io's agent that runs on devices. Its main role is to ensure your app is running, and keep communications with the Resin API server.

The Supervisor itself has its own API, with means for user applications to communicate and execute some special actions that affect the host OS or the application itself. There are two main ways for the application to interact with the Supervisor: the update lockfile and the HTTP API.

Only Supervisors after version 1.1.0 have all of this functionality. This corresponds to OS images downloaded after October 14th 2015.

## Update locking

Locking updates means that the Supervisor will not be able to kill your application. This is meant to be used at critical sections of your code where you don't want to be interrupted, or to control that updates are only installed at certain times.

In order to do this, users can create a file called `/data/resin-updates.lock` that will prevent the Supervisor from killing and restarting the app. As any other lockfile, the Supervisor itself will create such file before killing the app, so you should only create it in exclusive mode. This means: only create the lockfile if it doesn't already exist. Several tools exist to simplify this process, for example [npm/lockfile](https://github.com/npm/lockfile).

Using the above-mentioned library, the lock can be acquired like in this CoffeeScript example:
```coffeescript
	lockFile = require 'lockfile'

	lockFile.lock '/data/resin-updates.lock', (err) ->
		# A non-null err probably means the supervisor is about to kill us
		throw new Error('Could not acquire lock: ', err) if err?

		# Here we have the lock, so we can do critical stuff:
		doTheHarlemShake()

		# Now we release the lock, and we can be killed again
		lockFile.unlock '/data/resin-updates.lock', (err) ->
			# If err is not null here, something went really wrong
			throw err if err?
```

There are other libraries you can use in different languages, for example [this Python library](http://pythonhosted.org/lockfile/lockfile.html#examples).

### Overriding the lock

The update lock can be overriden in case you need to force an update, for instance, if your app has hung in a critical section.

The way to do this is hitting the `/v1/update` endpoint of the supervisor HTTP API, with `{ "force": true }` as body. See below for the full API reference. More interfaces to override this lock will be added soon.

## HTTP API reference

The supervisor exposes an HTTP API on port 48484 (`RESIN_SUPERVISOR_PORT`).

**All endpoints require an apikey parameter, which is exposed to the application as `RESIN_SUPERVISOR_API_KEY`.**

The full address for the API, i.e. `"http://127.0.0.1:48484"`, is available as `RESIN_SUPERVISOR_ADDRESS`. **Always use these variables when communicating via the API, since address and port could change**.

Alternatively, the Resin API (api.resin.io) has a proxy endpoint at `POST /supervisor/<url>` (where `<url>` is one of the API URLs described below) from which you can send API commands to the supervisor remotely, using your Auth Token instead of your API key. Commands sent through the proxy require an `appId` and/or `deviceId` parameter in the body, and default to POST requests unless you specify a `method` parameter (e.g. "GET").

The API is versioned (currently at v1), except for `/ping`.

You might notice that the formats of some responses differ. This is because they were implemented later, and in Go instead of node.js.

Here's the full list of endpoints implemented so far. In all examples, replace everything between `< >` for the corresponding values.

```
Response:
```none
OK
```

### DELETE /v1/tcp-ping

When the device's connection to the Resin VPN is down, by default the device performs a TCP ping heartbeat to check for connectivity. This endpoint disables such TCP ping.

When successful, responds with an empty 204:

#### Examples:
From the app on the device:

### GET /v1/device

Introduced in supervisor v1.6.
Returns the current device state, as reported to the Resin API and with some extra fields added to allow control over pending/locked updates.
The state is a JSON object that contains some or all of the following:
* `api_port`: Port on which the supervisor is listening.
* `commit`: Hash of the current commit of the application that is running.
* `ip_address`: Space-separated list of IP addresses of the device.
* `status`: Status of the device regarding the app, as a string, i.e. "Stopping", "Starting", "Downloading", "Installing", "Idle".
* `download_progress`: Amount of the application image that has been downloaded, expressed as a percentage. If the update has already been downloaded, this will be `null`.
* `os_version`: Version of the host OS running on the device.
* `supervisor_version`: Version of the supervisor running on the device.
* `update_pending`: This one is not reported to the Resin API. It's a boolean that will be true if the supervisor has detected there is a pending update.
* `update_downloaded`: Not reported to the Resin API either. Boolean that will be true if a pending update has already been downloaded.
* `update_failed`: Not reported to the Resin API. Boolean that will be true if the supervisor has tried to apply a pending update but failed (i.e. if the app was locked, there was a network failure or anything else went wrong).

Other attributes may be added in the future, and some may be missing or null if they haven't been set yet.

#### Examples:
From the app on the device:
```bash
$ curl -X GET --header "Content-Type:application/json" \
	"$RESIN_SUPERVISOR_ADDRESS/v1/device?apikey=$RESIN_SUPERVISOR_API_KEY"
