# Getting Started with the Parallella Board

This guide will walk you through getting a [Parallella][parallella-link] board hooked up to your resin.io application.


## What You'll Need

* Any one of the [Parallella][parallella-link] boards.
* A 4GB or larger SD card.
  The [Parallella][parallella-link] uses a Micro SD card. The [speed class][speed_class] of the card also matters - this determines its maximum transfer rate. We strongly recommend you get ahold of a class 10 card or above.
* An ethernet cable or [WiFi adapter][wifi] to connect your device to the
  internet. Note: At the time of writing, there is no easy way of changing the wifi `SSID` and `PASSWORD` after the download. This will be worked out pretty soon and some awesome new tools will help :D
* A USB male Micro-B to female Standard-A cable.
* A high quality 2000mA rated 5V DC power supply with 5.5mm OD / 2.1mm ID center positive polarity plug.
* A micro HDMI to HDMI cable (optional).
* A fan (optional, but highly recommended!).
* Some awesome ideas to hack on! If you need inspiration, check out our
  [projects][projects] page.

<!-- ========================== Generic ALL devices =================================   -->

__NOTE:__ If you're not experienced with [git][git], check out the excellent
[Try Git][try-git] course at [Code School][code-school].

If you already have a resin.io account and just want to get started with your new device, then skip ahead to [Creating Your First Application](/installing/gettingStarted-Parallella#creating-your-first-application).

## Signing Up

Enter your details on the [sign up page][signup]. There are a couple of
restrictions:

* The username can only contain letters and numbers.
* The password has to be at least 8 characters long.

## SSH Key

SSH keys use the power of [public-key cryptography][pub_key_crypto] to secure
your connection when sending your code to us. In order to secure your [git][git]
connection, we need your __public__ [SSH Key][ssh_key] (you must never share
your *private* key with anyone.)

Simply paste your public key into the box provided on the UI and click `save`. Alternatively you can import your key from [Github][github]. If you don't have an ssh key or have never used one, we recommend you take a look at [Github][github]'s [excellent documentation][github_ssh] on the subject and how to generate a key pair for your platform.

<img src="/img/common/sign_up_flow/enter_ssh_key_cropped.png" width="80%">

Once generated, SSH keys are easy to use. In fact you generally don't have to
think about it at all. Once you're set up just `git push` your code to us and
it's taken care of automatically and securely.

If you don't have your ssh key setup yet, but want to explore resin.io, just click `skip`. Note that you will not be able to push code to your devices until you have an ssh key saved. This can be done at anytime from the `Preferences` page on the dashboard.

### Import SSH key From GitHub

For convenience we provide the ability to import your public SSH key from
[GitHub][github] - just click on the Octocat icon in the bottom right-hand
corner ([we use][github_ssh_blogpost] GitHub's [public APIs][github_apis] to
retrieve this data.)

You will then have to enter your github username:

<img src="/img/common/sign_up_flow/enter_github_username_cropped.png" width="60%">


## Creating Your First Application

The two key components you will interact with in resin.io are *applications* and
*devices* - applications represent the code you want to run on your devices, and
devices are the actual hardware itself.

You can have as many devices connected to an application as you like - when you
push code, resin.io deploys to every device that is part of that application.

To create your first application simply type in a name, select as your device type and click the create button. You should now be taken to the dashboard of your newly created application:

<img src="/img/common/main_dashboard/select_fleet_type.png" width="80%">

<!-- ========================== end section =================================   -->

## Adding Your First Device

This is the application dashboard where all of the devices connected to your
application will be shown, along with their statuses and logs.

<img src="/img/common/app/app_dashboard_empty.png" width="80%">

Click the `Download Device OS` button to get the resin.io operating system image for your application. A dialog will appear prompting you to specify some configuration information for your parallella.

You will need to select how your device connects to the internet - either via an ethernet cable or wifi, in which case you can specify your Wifi network's SSID and passphrase. You will additionally need to select your processor type, either **Z7010** or **Z7020** and the number of cores your co-processor has. Finally, you have the ability to enable HDMI on the board as well.

Once you have selected your board configuration, click the `Download Device OS` button to get the resin.io operating system image for your application.

![Empty Application Page](/img/parallella/wifi-settings-parallella.png)
While the file downloads ensure your SD card is formatted in [FAT32][fat32]
([WikiHow][wikihow] has [instructions][wikihow_format] on how to do this).

Once the download is finished you should have a `.zip` file with a name like `resin-myFleet-0.1.0-0.0.14.zip` where **myFleet** is the name you gave your application on the dashboard. Extract the `.zip` to a folder and you should see a OS `.img` in the folder. We will use this in the next steps.

Now we have to burn the downloaded `.img` file onto the SD card. There are a number of ways of doing this depending on your host operating system. We have listed a few below:


## Burning the OS image onto the SD card

### On Mac and Linux

####From the command line

First we need to figure out what our SD card is called. To do this open a terminal and execute the following command to see the list of connected storage devices:
`df -h`
Next, insert your microSD card and execute the following command again:
`df -h`
Compare the two outputs and find the newly added device. In my case, the microSD card was '/dev/disk2s1'.
Depending on your OS, this device can take different names, like '/dev/mmcblk0p1' or '/dev/sdb1'.

Once you've got the name of the SD card, you'll want to unmount that disk using the following command, replacing the specifics with your card details:
`sudo diskutil unmount /dev/disk2s1`
Now you'll want to execute the command that actually copies the image onto the SD card.

> You have to be really careful here, and make 100% sure you are entering the correct SD card details. You could end up copying over the wrong drive (such as your master hard disk) and then you're gonna have a bad time. Double check everything!

Also, choose the right file location for your `.img` file in the input file field (if=...).
`sudo dd bs=1m if=~/Downloads/resin-myFleet-0.1.0-0.0.14.img of=/dev/rdisk2`

__NOTE:__ that we subtly changed the device name from "/dev/disk2s1" to "/dev/rdisk2". You'll want to do the same when you execute the above command, with the corresponding device name. If your device name is "/dev/mmcblk0p1", use "/dev/mmcblk0". If it's "/dev/sdb1", use "/dev/sdb". The idea is to use the device name for the whole SD card and not just a partition. If you're not sure, use `ls /dev` before and after inserting the card and note the difference.

__NOTE:__ Linux users will need to run `sudo dd bs=1M if=~/Downloads/resin-myFleet-0.1.0-0.0.14.img of=/dev/rdisk2` (uppercase M)

This process can take anywhere from 5-30 minutes depending on the speed of your computer and microSD card. Once this is done, skip down to [setting up your device](/installing/gettingStarted-Parallella#setting-up-your-device)

#### From a GUI

Alternatively you can use the GUI program [PiFiller][pifiller-download] to burn the SD card, although this looks like it is made specifically for the Raspberry Pi, don't worry, it works just the same.

Once downloaded, launch Pi Filler, and follow the on-screen prompts. The first thing it will ask is for you to locate your `.img` file.

Locate your Parallella `.img` file in your Downloads folder. It should be named something like `resin-myFleet-0.1.0-0.0.14.img`. Now click "choose".

You can now insert your microSD card into your host machine and click continue. PiFiller will look for your SD card and tell you when it finds it.

__NOTE:__ make 100% sure that the SD card it finds is in fact the correct card.

Click continue and piFiller will write to the SD card. This can take 5-25 minutes depending on your machine. Once this is done, skip down to [setting up your device](/installing/gettingStarted-Parallella#setting-up-your-device).

### Windows

To burn OS images to SD cards on Windows, you will need to install [Win32 disk imager][win32-disk-imager]. Once you download it, you can launch win32 disk imager by clicking on the "Win32DiskImager" file in the folder that you extracted it to.

Now in Win32DiskImager, click on the folder icon to select which `.img` file you wish to burn. A file browser window will open and you will need to select your beaglebone image from the Downloads folder. It should be the extracted version and named something like this `resin-myFleet-0.1.0-0.0.14.img`.

Next insert your SD card into your host computer and in the Win32DiskImager GUI, select your SD card when it appears.

__NOTE:__ Be very careful to make sure that you have selected the right SD card. Double check this!! Otherwise you could end up writing over your host machine's harddisk.

Once you have made your selections and are 100% sure you are writing to your SD card and nothing else, you can click write and wait for the SD card to be burned.

Once it is completed, you can carry on setting up your raspberry pi as shown below.

## Setting Up Your Device

Put the SD card into your device and connect either the ethernet cable or WiFi adapter. If you're connecting the cable to your computer, you'll need to enable connection sharing. Now power up the device by inserting the USB cable.

It will take a few minutes for the raspberry pi to appear on your resin.io dashboard, so take this time to grab some tea while you wait.

While you wait resin.io is expanding the partitioning on your SD card, installing a custom linux environment and establishing a secure connection with our servers.

If you have a class 10 SD card and a fast internet connection your device should appear on the dashboard in around 7 minutes. Note that Class 4 SD cards can take up to 3 times longer so it's well worth investing in the fastest card you can find.

## Running Code On Your Device

![git pushing](/img/screenshots/git_pushing.png)

To start with, we will just run the standard "Hello, World!" example from parallella which uses the epiphany sdk. This demo allows the epiphany C code to be cross-compiled in the cloud.

If you look at the code [here][parallella-demo-link], you will notice the code has a `Dockerfile` which is a recipe file that allows you to define your build and runtime environment. We recommend you have a look at how to effectively use [dockerfiles][dockerfile].

To clone it, run the following in a terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/resin-io-projects/parallella-demo.git
```

Once the repo is cloned, cd into the newly created `parallella-demo` directory and add the resin git endpoint by running the `git remote add` command shown in the top-right corner of the application dashboard page, e.g.:

```
cd parallella-demo

git remote add resin joebloggs@git.resin.io:joebloggs/skynet.git
```

Now you can simply run `git push resin master` and push your code up to our servers where they will distribute it to your device(s). If this fails, you may need to force the push by running `git push resin master --force`.

__NOTE:__ On your very first push, git may ask you if you would like to add this host to your list of allowed hosts. Don't worry about this, just type 'yes' and carry on your merry way.

You'll know your code has been successfully compiled and built when our
friendly unicorn mascot appears in your terminal:

![git pushing](/img/screenshots/git_pushed.png)

The terminal will also say:
```
-----> Image created successfully!
-----> Uploading image..
       Image uploaded successfully!
```

This means your code is safely on our servers and will be downloaded and executed by all the devices you have connected to your application. You may have to wait a little while for the code to start running on your devices. You can see the progress of the device code updates on the device dashboard:
<!-- TODO: add images for Parallella specifically -->
<!-- ![Code updating](/img/screenshots/rpi-app-updating.png) -->

You should now see the "Hello, World!" text printed in your Parallella's dashboard on resin.io.
