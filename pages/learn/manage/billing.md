# Billing

The billing page can be found in the dropdown at the top-right of the dashboard, directly beneath the account preferences. From this dashboard, you can update your information, change your payment plan, monitor your usage, and download invoices.

## Account settings and usage

At the top of the dashboard, you'll find a summary of your subscription with information on the total amount and due date for your next payment:

Beneath this you can see your current usage, including devices and collaborators:

Beginning August 1st, 2018, your usage will be monitored to make sure you don't have more devices or collaborators than your plan allows. Any usage over your subscription limits will be [automatically added to your bill][autobill].

Further down, you'll find a place to download invoices, add or edit payment methods, and update account information:

At the bottom of this page, you'll find more information on the available [payment plans][payment], and you can change plans as necessary.

## Automated billing

From August 1st, 2018, and onward, we will be tracking your usage. For any usage that is outside the limits defined by your plan, you will be automatically billed. Automated billing for devices and users outside of your plan will occur every month, even for those on annual plans.

We calculate usage based on the maximum number of concurrent devices and users in your account during the month. **This includes all active devices, whether online or offline.** Charges for usage outside your plan will show up under the *Add-ons* section of your invoice. If you prefer, you can still contact us to pre-purchase devices and users and have them added to your plan, rather than be automatically billed in arrears for additional devices and users.

If you have devices that will be inactive for long periods of time, you can mark them as `Inactive`. This will keep them from being counted towards your device total. Weâ€™ll charge a one-time deactivation fee, and the devices will remain inactive until they come online.

To mark a device as `Inactive`,
