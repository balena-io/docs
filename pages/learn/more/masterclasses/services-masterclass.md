# Balena Services Masterclass

* **Masterclass Type:** Core
* **Maximum Expected Time To Complete:** 120 minutes

## Prerequisite Classes

This masterclass builds upon knowledge that has been taught in previous classes.
To gain the most from this masterclass, we recommend that you first undertake
the following masterclasses:

* [balena CLI Masterclass](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli-masterclass)

## Introduction

Balena applications consist of one or more balena services, which are based upon
Docker images, containers, volumes and networks. This allows applications to be
extremely flexible, allowing services to be isolated with access only to part
of the host required, as well as defining their own networking and data
requirements.

This masterclass acts as an introduction to how both single service and
multicontainer applications operate, as well as demonstrating some of their most
common uses and some advanced techniques.

In this masterclass, you will learn how to:

* Build a single service
* Persist data across application updates
* Communicate between containers and the outside world
* Run `systemd` inside your `balenalib` container
* Reduce the image size for compiled code

## Hardware and Software Requirements

It is assumed that the reader has access to the following:

* A locally cloned copy of this repository
	[Balena Services Masterclass](https://github.com/balena-io/services-masterclass).
	Either:
  * `git clone https://github.com/balena-io/services-masterclass.git`
  * Download ZIP file (from 'Clone or download'->'Download ZIP') and then unzip it to a suitable directory
* A balena supported device, such as a [balenaFin 1.1](https://store.balena.io/products/balenafin-developer-kit-v1-1-cm3-l),
	[Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)
	or [Intel NUC](https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/products/boards-kits/nuc.html). If you don't have a device, you can emulate an Intel NUC by
	installing VirtualBox and following [this guide](https://www.balena.io/blog/no-hardware-use-virtualbox/)
* A suitable text editor for developing code on your development platform (e.g.
    [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
* A suitable shell environment for command execution (such as `bash`)
* A [balenaCloud](https://www.balena.io/) account
* Some familiarity with [Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/)
* An installation of [balena CLI](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

## Exercises

All of the following exercises assume that you are able to access a suitable
Unix based shell and that balena CLI is installed. The exercises include
commands which can be run in such a shell, and are represented by a line
prefixed with `$`. Information returned from execution of a command may be
appended under the line to show what might be returned. For example:

```shell
$ balena version
11.11.2
```

### 1. Service Images, Containers, Volumes and Networks

Balena applications are comprised of service images, containers and volumes.
When an application is built, one or more images are generated by the builders
and then stored in balena's registries. When a device downloads an application,
it retrieves these images from the registries and then stores them locally.

The device Supervisor then examines the images (and any docker-compose manifest
associated with them) to determine how to create those services as containers,
which form executable instances of an image.

Additionally, volumes (persistent data stores) can be bound to an executable
container to ensure that data exists across the service's lifespan.

#### 1.1 Service Images

Service images are the basis for any service. They are comprised of the binaries
and data for running services, but they also contain metadata that informs
balenaEngine how to initialize and configure the service. As such, an image
is essentially a self-contained GNU/Linux filesystem with everything required for
running an instance of GNU/Linux, except for the kernel.

Images specified as an `image` tag can be produced by a variety of sources
including locally on a developer's machine, by pushing in localmode to a balena
device or by the balena builders, which use Dockerfiles to determine what to
include in the image. The following exercises all use the balenaCloud builder to
build images.

See [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) for more
information on Dockerfiles.

#### 1.2 Service Containers

When a service container is created, balenaEngine uses a service image as a
'template' for that container, creating an instance of a filesystem containing
all of the files from the image, as well as using the metadata associated with
it for configuration.

Service containers are writable, allowing data to be written and read
from any directory within that service on its locally created filesystem
layers. However, these layers only exist for the lifespan of the container.
Containers are recreated for multiple reasons. These can include newer versions
of a service image being downloaded, alterations to environment variables names
or values, a change in network configuration, etc.

As such, it is never safe to rely on data existing in a service container layer
above that of the lifespan of that service container. Temporary data is
therefore acceptable use, but any data that is required to persist across
container recreation should be stored in persistent volumes.

Note that service recreation is *not* the same as restarting. Restarting a
service does not require its recreation, and implies that nothing has changed
in the configuration requirements of the service container. However, it can
be tricky to determine when a service might be recreated or restarted
(note there is currently
[an issue](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-supervisor/issues/1116) with the
Supervisor where the `/v2/applications/:appId/restart-service` endpoint actually
recreates the service container rather than restarting it).

#### 1.3 Service Volumes

Volumes are persistent storage areas which do not get erased when a service
container is recreated. These volumes are usually bound to a service container
on a specific path, and are stored on the host filesystem without any
sort of diff mechanism (that is, any file hierarchy data written to the volume
is always available in that hierarchy).

For single service applications (e.g. non-multicontainer applications without
a `docker-compose` manifest), there is a default persistent volume bound to
the `/data` directory in the service. This path can always be considered
persistent.

For multicontainer applications, named volumes must be defined as part of the
`docker-compose` manifest, which can then be bound to services via their
definitions.

Both types of applications are detailed in the following exercises.

### 2. Single Service Applications

Single service applications, as the name suggests, consist of a single unique
service. These are defined using a `Dockerfile`, `Dockerfile.template` or
`package.json` file, which is built either by a balena environment, a host
development machine or a balena device. The resulting service image is then
downloaded to all devices provisioned against their application and executed
on-device by the balenaEngine.

Single service applications are *always* privileged. That is, they have access
to all of the host device nodes, capabilities, permissions, etc. It's vital to
understand this, as essentially there is no difference between any executables
running in a privileged service container to that of running on the host itself.
Additionally, single service applications *always* use host networking, allowing
them to bind to any of the host's network interfaces.

If security and sandboxing (which are the primary concern of the container
paradigm) are required for either privilege level or to ensure self-contained
networking, then a multicontainer application should be used (even if only one
service is required).

#### 2.1 Building and Deploying a Single Service Application

For convenience, export a variable to point to the root of this masterclass
repository, as we'll use this for the rest of the exercises, e.g.:

```shell
$ export BALENA_SERVICES_MASTERCLASS=~/services-masterclass
```

Now change directory to the `single-service-app` directory in the root of this
masterclass repository, e.g.:

```shell
$ cd $BALENA_SERVICES_MASTERCLASS/single-service-app
```

Ensure you've created a new named application (for example, 'SingleService')
for your balenaFin (or alternative device). Download and provision a development
device image for that application and flash it onto your device. If you haven't
already done so, login to your account using balena CLI with `balena login` and
choose an appropriate authentication method.

Now build the Dockerfile for the application:

```shell
$ balena push SingleService
[Info]     Starting build for SingleService, user heds

			            ,.-' >.'
			           <.'_.''
			             <'
```

This will build and deploy the application service to your provisioned device.

#### 2.2 Service Restarts

There's a fairly common misconception that a service will run once and then
stop. This is in fact not the case, and most service containers have a lifespan
that is only as long as it takes to execute the `CMD` instruction in their
associated Dockerfile (there are exceptions to this rule, but it's usually down
to the type of `init` system being used, see the
['Running systemd in a Service'](#5-running-systemd-in-a-service) section for more
details).

After deploying the single service application, you'll notice the following in
the logs for the device (assuming our device's UUID is `1234567`):

```shell
$ balena logs 1234567
07.10.19 16:41:56 (+0100) Started service 'main sha256:729c0acb2b669929944a68329e7856ac0f356c7e0daabc29b78dbd768f25623f'
07.10.19 16:41:56 (+0100)  main  Single Service Application
07.10.19 16:42:02 (+0100) Service exited 'main sha256:729c0acb2b669929944a68329e7856ac0f356c7e0daabc29b78dbd768f25623f'
07.10.19 16:42:04 (+0100) Restarting service 'main sha256:729c0acb2b669929944a68329e7856ac0f356c7e0daabc29b78dbd768f25623f'
07.10.19 16:41:56 (+0100)  main  Single Service Application
07.10.19 16:42:03 (+0100)  main  Single Service Application
07.10.19 16:42:11 (+0100) Service exited 'main sha256:729c0acb2b669929944a68329e7856ac0f356c7e0daabc29b78dbd768f25623f'
07.10.19 16:42:13 (+0100) Restarting service 'main sha256:729c0acb2b669929944a68329e7856ac0f356c7e0daabc29b78dbd768f25623f'
...
```

As you can see, the service is restarting every five seconds because the `CMD`
instruction simply echoes some text to the console, sleeps for five seconds and
then exits. The default restart policy for services in a balena application is
`always` for single service applications (see
[here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#restart)
for alternative restart policies for services in multicontainer applications).

We can actually ensure the service never restarts by ensuring that the `CMD`
instruction never returns. Do this by editing the `Dockerfile.template` file
and altering the line:

```Dockerfile
CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo 'Single Service Application'; sleep 5"]
```

to

```Dockerfile
CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo 'Single Service Application'; sleep infinity"]
```

and then carrying out a push to the application:

```shell
$ balena push SingleService
[Info]     Starting build for SingleService, user heds

			<`\\_  \         .`-.
			 \ r-7  `-. ._  ' .  `\
			  \`,      `-.`7  7)   )
			   \/         \|  \'  / `-._
			              ||    .'
			               \\  (
			                >\  >
			            ,.-' >.'
			           <.'_.''
			             <'
```

You'll now see the logs update to:

```shell
$ balena logs 1234567
...
07.10.19 16:43:13 (+0100) Started service 'main sha256:40e00023dacc51383788d462548b6fb7880a9561b784306b01984ac7ce4e529e'
07.10.19 16:43:12 (+0100)  main  Single Service Application
```

It is therefore important when writing services to ensure that if they are
expected to exit and not restart, then the restart policy should be altered
accordingly.

#### 2.3 Persistent Data

In a single service application, permanent data can be stored in the `/data`
directory. Change the `CMD` line in the `Dockerfile.template` to:

```Dockerfile
CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "date >> /data/datestamps; sleep infinity"]
```

then `balena push` to the app and wait for it to restart. Now SSH into the
`main` service on the device:

```shell
$ balena ssh 1234567 main
root@1234567:/# cat /data/datestamps
Tue Oct  8 10:48:38 UTC 2019
root@1234567:/# exit
```

Now re-push that app and then SSH back into the service after it is recreated:

```shell
$ balena push SingleService
$ balena ssh 1234567 main
root@1234567:/# cat /data/datestamps
Tue Oct  8 10:48:38 UTC 2019
Tue Oct  8 10:52:44 UTC 2019
root@1234567:/# exit
```

As can be seen, all previous data has persisted.

### 3. Multicontainer Applications

Multicontainer applications allow more than one service to run on a device at
the same time. This allows application developers to split their application up
into logical components where each component handles a different function of
the application.

Unlike single service applications, balenaEngine will generate an internal
bridge network for services to communicate between themselves. This bridge
allows the ingress of network traffic from host interfaces only to services
which have explicitly specified that they listen on given ports.

#### 3.1 Multicontainer `docker-compose` Manifest

Balena allows the configuration of a multicontainer service application via the
use of a `docker-compose` manifest. This is a list of all services, including
any capabilities, permissions, access, environment variables, etc. that each
service may require, as well as the definition and configuration of any shared
resources that those services may require. One very important difference between
single service and multicontainer applications is that multicontainer services
are *not* privileged by default. This means that if you want access to host
device nodes, capabilities, etc. then you need to either enable privileged
access within the `docker-compose` manifest, or pick a subset of the access
that the service requires using relevant keywords in that service definition.

To demonstrate a multicontainer application, we'll start with a couple of very
simple services that we'll build up to include some security sandboxing and
access to the host.

Create a new application called 'MulticontainerServices', download a development
device image and provision your device with it.

First change to the multicontainer part of the masterclass repository, and then
push the code that exists there:

```shell
$ cd $BALENA_SERVICES_MASTERCLASS/multicontainer-app
$ balena push MulticontainerServices
[Info]      Starting build for MulticontainerServices, user heds

			            ,.-' >.'
			           <.'_.''
			             <'
```

This will create an application with a single service that acts as a frontend,
which allows an HTTP GET from the root of the device. Determine the IP address
of the device, by doing:

```shell
$ balena devices | grep MulticontainerServices
12345678 0987654 restless-bush    fincm3          MulticontainerServices Idle   true      10.2.2             balenaOS 2.43.0+rev1 https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/devices/098765493a9a14ad383505563a113f/summary
$ balena device 0987654 | grep IP
IP ADDRESS:         192.168.1.167
```

And then send an HTTP request using `curl`:

```shell
$ curl http://192.168.1.167
This is the frontend root
```

This shows the device exposing port 80 (HTTP) and responding with some data
when an HTTP GET is requested.

We'll add another service which will act as a backend that supplies data to the
frontend. The code for this already exists in the
`$BALENA_SERVICES_MASTERCLASS/multicontainer-app/backend` directory, but is not used
as the `docker-compose` manifest does not define another service that uses it.
To do so, we'll add a new service to the manifest and alter the frontend code
slightly to try and use the backend. In the `docker-compose.yml` manifest,
add the following after the `frontend` service definition:

```yaml
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "1234:1234"
```

Push to the application again. Once the application has built and the device has
downloaded the updates, prove that you can acquire the backend data from your
development machine:

```shell
$ curl http://192.168.1.167:1234/data
2019-10-08T15:36:14.729Z
```

#### 3.2 Persistent Data

Unlike single service applications, multicontainer applications do not bind a
persistent storage volume automatically into a service container. Instead,
volumes need to be explicitly defined in the `docker-compose` manifest in
named volume format. Only named volumes are supported, as no host directories
may be bound into a service container (for OS stability and safety issues).

To demonstrate persistent volumes in a multicontainer application, add the
following to near the beginning of the `docker-compose.yml` file, after the
`version` line:

```yaml
volumes:
  my-first-volume:
  a-second-volume:
```

These can then be used by services to store persistent data by binding a named
volume into the service. Add the following to the end of the `frontend`
service definition in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - 'my-first-volume:/frontend-data'
      - 'a-second-volume:/backend-data'
```

And the following to the end of the `backend` service definition:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - 'a-second-volume:/backend-persistence'
```

These lines will bind both named volumes into the `frontend` service at
path locations `/frontend-data` and `/backend-data`, and just the
`a-second-volume` named volume into the `backend` service at
`/backend-persistence`. Now push to the application again:

```shell
$ balena push MulticontainerServices
```

Once built and the device has downloaded the updated application, SSH into the
`frontend` service:

```shell
$ balena ssh 0987654 frontend
root@0987654:/usr/src/app# echo 'First volume' > /frontend-data/somedata
root@0987654:/usr/src/app# echo 'Second volume' > /backend-data/somedata
root@0987654:/usr/src/app# exit
```

Now SSH into the `backend` service, to verify that data stored by the `frontend`
service into the shared volume can be seen by the `backend` service:

```shell
root@0987654:/usr/src/app# cat /backend-persistence/somedata
Second volume
root@0987654:/usr/src/app# echo 'Second volume 2' >> /backend-persistence/somedata
root@0987654:/usr/src/app# exit
```

Now re-push that application to the device:

```shell
$ balena push MulticontainerServices
```

Wait for the device to update, then SSH into the `frontend` container to verify
that all the stored data from both services has correctly persisted:

```shell
$ balena ssh 0987654 frontend
root@0987654:/usr/src/app# cat /frontend-data/somedata
First volume
root@0987654:/usr/src/app# cat /backend-data/somedata
Second volume
Second volume 2
root@0987654:/usr/src/app# exit
```

### 4. Networking Types

There are two main types of networking supported by balenaEngine, `host` and
`bridge` networks. There are some differences between them:

* `host` mode allows a service to use all host network interfaces
* `bridge` mode uses a bridge network interface which all service containers
    are connected to

This means a couple of things when developing applications. Any service that
uses `host` networking does not have to explicitly define ports for traffic
ingress, and a service can bind to all interfaces and expect incoming traffic
to the host. Single service applications *always* use `host` networking.

By contrast, `bridge` networking essentially isolates all services from the
host, requiring services to explicitly define open ports to allow traffic from
the host to be passed to them (although all outgoing connections are allowed
and will allow incoming data from those connections). By default, multicontainer
application servers always use a self-defined `bridge` network.

There's a couple of points to note alongside this:

* Most backend services in production applications are not publicly exposed
    (that is, they are not useable outside of the host machine) to ensure
    security and to ensure there is only one or two main endpoints (for example
    an API service)
* Some services may want direct access to host capabilities (such as device
    nodes), and it's generally more sensible to sandbox these services away
    from public access

Given this knowledge, and how we've defined our `frontend` and `backend`
services, you can see that we're using both `host` (for the `frontend` service)
and `bridge` (for the `backend` service) networking. The backend shouldn't
really be exposed, as we want the frontend to retrieve data from it and
then pass it to an external query.

Here's a diagram showing what's currently happens with network traffic:

![host and bridged network diagram](https://github.com/balena-io/services-masterclass/blob/master/resources/HostAndBridged.png?raw=true)

And here's a diagram showing what we want to happen:

![bridged network diagram](https://github.com/balena-io/services-masterclass/blob/master/resources/Bridged.png?raw=true)

In short, we want to ensure that the `backend` service is not reachable from
any component that isn't connected to it via the same bridge, and that only
the `frontend` is exposed to the host and beyond.

To do this, we're going to remove host network access from the `frontend`
service to allow external incoming network traffic into it, as well as ensure
only incoming requests from the same bridge (i.e. the `frontend` service) are
allowed into the `backend` service.

Modify the services section of the `docker-compose.yml` file to the following:

```yaml
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    expose:
      - "1234"
```

The `expose` keyword exposes specified network ports on the `backend` component
only to services on the same bridge (in this case `frontend`). This is not
strictly required because in current versions of balenaEngine (and Docker)
services on the same bridge have access to all other services ports, but for our
purposes it reinforces the idea of this behavior.

Now add the following to the
`$BALENA_SERVICES_MASTERCLASS/multicontainer-app/frontend/index.js` file:

```javascript
app.get('/backend_data', (_req, res) => {
    request('http://backend:1234/data', (err, data) => {
        if (err) {
            res.send(`Error: ${err}\n`).status(500);
        } else {
            res.send(`Backend data says: ${data.body}\n`);
        }
    });
});
```

Each service can be referenced as a host by its service name by any other
service on the same bridge. For this reason, an HTTP request to `backend`
from the `frontend` service will resolve to the correct internal IP address
for the `backend` service.

Push to the application again:

```shell
$ balena push MulticontainerServices
```

Let's try using the same endpoints as before to request some HTTP data from
both the `frontend` and `backend` services from your development machine:

```shell
$ curl http://192.168.1.167
This is the frontend root
$ curl http://192.168.1.167:1234/data
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 192.168.1.167 port 1234: Connection refused
```

You can see we are no longer able to talk to request data from the `backend`
service, as it's not allowing incoming data outside of the bridge network it
exists on. However, if we now request data from the `/backend_data` endpoint
on the `front` service, we'll see it uses data it requests from the `backend`
service in the same bridge:

```shell
$ curl http://192.168.1.167/backend_data
Backend data says: 2019-10-09T11:35:44.756Z
```

The balena Supervisor also supports the creation of multiple bridge networks,
allowing you to compartmentalize further (so that some services exist in only
one defined network, whereas others might be able to communicate in many).
There's a good section on this in the Docker
[networking guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/#specify-custom-networks).

balena `docker-compose` manifests also allow the defining of IPAM
bridge networks; see
[here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#ipv4_address-ipv6_address)
for more details, as well as the
[`aliases`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#aliases)
keyword for providing alias names for services (including FQDNs).

### 5. Running `systemd` in a Service

**Note:** This section assumes some pre-existing knowledge of
    [`systemd`](https://github.com/systemd/systemd), which is an
    [init](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init) system that uses ordering rules
    to determine which processes should be executed, and in what order.

Most services are designed to run a single executable, and with the advent of
multicontainer applications this allowed an application to contain many
services, each of which was responsible for a portion of the whole. Whilst this
is the preferred method of operation for applications, there are times where
several processes may be required to run in unison within a single service.
balena supports the use of `systemd` within services, by either running as
`privileged` containers, or via some carefully crafted capabilities.

Change directory to the `systemd` directory in the root of this masterclass
repository, e.g.:

```shell
$ cd $BALENA_SERVICES_MASTERCLASS/systemd
```

Ensure you've created a new named application (for example, 'systemd')
for your balenaFin (or alternative device). Download and provision a development
device image for that application and flash it onto your device. If you haven't
already done so, login to your account using balena CLI with `balena login` and
choose an appropriate authentication method. Make a note of the UUID of the
device.

The `$BALENA_SERVICES_MASTERCLASS/systemd/printer/Dockerfile.template` is
initially empty. We need to fill this in to create a service image that installs
`systemd` as the init process. Add the following to the file:

```Dockerfile
FROM balenalib/%%BALENA_MACHINE_NAME%%-debian-node:10-buster

# Install both DBus and systemd support
RUN install_packages dbus systemd

# Mask services which do not make sense to run in a service container
RUN systemctl mask \
    dev-hugepages.mount \
    sys-fs-fuse-connections.mount \
    sys-kernel-config.mount \
    display-manager.service \
    getty@.service \
    systemd-logind.service \
    systemd-remount-fs.service \
    getty.target \
    graphical.target
```

This installs `systemd` as well as `dbus` (which `systemd` requires) together
using a suitable Debian base image and then masks services that do should not be
run inside a container.

Now we need to use a suitable entry point that will execute `systemd` as the
init process. There's actually already a suitable shell script for this, in
`$BALENA_SERVICES_MASTERCLASS/systemd/printer/entry.sh`. This entry script
ensures that console output does not close on script exit, and then executes
`systemd` to act as the init process (via the use of `exec`, which ensures that
it runs as PID 1). We'll copy this entry script into the service image and then
set it as the service entrypoint. Add the following to the end of what you've
already added to
`$BALENA_SERVICES_MASTERCLASS/systemd/printer/Dockerfile.template`:

```Dockerfile
# Copy our systemd entrypoint script and ensure it's used
COPY entry.sh /usr/bin
STOPSIGNAL 37
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/entry.sh"]
```

Note the `STOPSIGNAL` directive. By default balenaEngine (and Docker) will send
the `SIGTERM` signal to PID 1 (whatever executable is started using `CMD`
or in our case `systemd` started from the `entry.sh` script). However, `systemd`
requires that `RTMIN+3` is sent to it to initiate a shutdown. As such, we change
the stop signal sent here to ensure `systemd` shuts down cleanly when the
service container is stopped.

We're now ready to push the multicontainer application for running `systemd` to
your application:

We've cut down the build log a bit, to make it shorter. Wait for the application
to be downloaded and started on the device, then look at the logs for the

We've not printed all the logs here, as there'll be a lot, but it shows that
`systemd` has successfully started as the init process.

SSH into the service, and then run `systemctl` to see all of the services
currently running:

```shell
$ balena ssh 3456789 printer
$ root@dffe197d303e:/# systemctl

...
```

Again, the list has been edited for brevity, but you can see that we've now
a running, non-exiting `systemd`-based service container.

There is a problem with how we're running our container, though. Have a look at
the definition of the `printer` service for the
`$BALENA_SERVICES_MASTERCLASS/systemd/docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
  printer:
    privileged: true
    build: ./printer
```

The immediately obvious issue here is that we've set this to be a privileged
service. Why? Because `systemd` actually requires several capabilities and mount
points that otherwise wouldn't be available. However, running a service as
privileged just because you need `systemd` inside it is not a very satisfactory
solution. So, what we'll do instead is now make some changes to the service
definition to run it non-privileged.

Change the `printer` service definition to the following:

```yaml
	printer:
    build: ./printer
    cap_add:
      - SYS_RESOURCE
      - SYS_ADMIN
    security_opt:
      - 'apparmor:unconfined'
    tmpfs:
      - /sys/fs/cgroup
```

This removes the privileged mode, but sets some extended access for the service,
mainly:

* Removing default resource limits and allow system administration options
    to be used
* The unconfining of the AppArmor kernel module, to allow `systemd` to run
    correctly
* A RAM based tmpfs mount to allow `systemd` to handle its own control groups
    set

Whilst there are a lot of access options here that do use the host, it should
be noted this is still better than the use of `privileged` mode.

Push the application again with the changes:

A quick SSH into the `printer` service will show that `systemd` is still running
as the init process:

```shell
$ balena ssh 3456789 printer
$ root@dffe197d303e:/# systemctl
UNIT                               LOAD   ACTIVE     SUB       DESCRIPTION

-.mount                            loaded active     mounted   /
dev-mqueue.mount                   loaded active     mounted   POSIX Message Queue File System
etc-hostname.mount                 loaded active     mounted   /etc/hostname
etc-hosts.mount                    loaded active     mounted   /etc/hosts
etc-resolv.conf.mount              loaded active     mounted   /etc/resolv.conf
sys-kernel-debug.mount             loaded active     mounted   Kernel Debug File System
...
```

Whilst we've now mostly dealt with running `systemd` in a container, for
completeness we'll also show how to quickly add a service so it starts when the
service container is started. Add the following to the end of the
`$BALENA_SERVICES_MASTERCLASS/systemd/printer/Dockerfile.template` file:

```Dockerfile
# Install the systemd printer service
COPY printer.service /etc/systemd/system
RUN systemctl enable printer.service

# Install any required modules for the printer service
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package* ./
RUN npm ci --production && npm cache clean --force && rm -rf /tmp/*
COPY index.js ./
```

This will copy the `systemd` printer service file into the relevant directory
for `systemd` to use it, enable that service and then build the code for
that service.

Now `balena push systemd` again, wait for the device to download the updated
application and then examine the logs:

```shell
$ balena logs 3456789
[Logs]    [10/10/2019, 3:36:10 PM] Started service 'printer sha256:2dc7b5f95cce246a26341eee02cb6e0d4ac93b715036fbe1858a7afda66062b3'
[Logs]    [10/10/2019, 3:36:10 PM] [printer] Systemd init system enabled.
...

[Logs]    [10/10/2019, 3:36:12 PM] [printer] [13782.614657] npm[44]: > node index.js
[Logs]    [10/10/2019, 3:36:23 PM] [printer] [13792.964777] npm[44]: Time is now Thu, 10 Oct 2019 14:36:23 GMT
[Logs]    [10/10/2019, 3:36:33 PM] [printer] [13802.960305] npm[44]: Time is now Thu, 10 Oct 2019 14:36:33 GMT
```

This allows any `systemd` services to be added as required, with any dependency
on other services they may need.

### 6. Multi-stage Builds

Whilst the majority of services install packages that are required for their
everyday operation, occasionally the building of a package or code needs to
occur (for example when using your own code in an image, or using specific
versions that may not be packaged for the base image OS being used).
Dockerfile instructions make this easy to do, but it also brings with it the
problem of increasing the size of a service image where, for example, source
code used to build a required executable for the service is included but never
used in the running service container.

Multi-stage builds offer the ability for a user to define one or more images
which include all of the tools and code needed to build an executable, and then
define a final image which copies that executable into it, without any of
the dependencies required to build it. This results in a far smaller service
image.

Change directory to the `multi-stage` directory in the root of this masterclass
repository, e.g.:

```shell
$ cd $BALENA_SERVICES_MASTERCLASS/multi-stage
```

Ensure you've created a new named application (for example, 'Multistage')
for your balenaFin (or alternative device). Download and provision a development
device image for that application and flash it onto your device. If you haven't
already done so, login to your account using balena CLI with `balena login` and
choose an appropriate authentication method. Make a note of the UUID of the
device.

To demonstrate multistage builds, look at the
`$BALENA_SERVICES_MASTERCLASS/multi-stage/Dockerfile.template` file, which shows
the following:

```Dockerfile
FROM balenalib/%%BALENA_MACHINE_NAME%%-debian:buster

# Install build essential tools to include GCC
RUN install_packages build-essential

# Compile the executable from some C source
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY hello-world.c ./
RUN gcc -static -o hello-world hello-world.c

CMD ["/usr/src/app/hello-world"]
```

This uses a Debian Buster base image and installs the appropriate build tools
(compiler, linker, headers, etc.) to build the small `hello-world` program.
Note that we're building a static executable here, without any dependencies
on shared libraries. This makes the final `hello-world` executable larger than
it otherwise would be, but it is completely self-contained.

Let's push our application code to the builders and deploy to the device:

```shell
$ balena push Multistage

As you can see, a *lot* of dependencies were installed to be able to build
our executable program.

Now wait for the device to download and run the application, and then SSH into
the device. We want to see how big our service image, which is just printing
`Hello, world!` and then exiting, is:

```shell
$ balena ssh 1234567
root@1234567:~# balena images | grep registry2
registry2.balena-cloud.com/v2/d84f78e591f230e4b5c9f20b00123456   <none>              2845b9f1a3fe        13 minutes ago      289MB
```

For an application of a couple of lines, 289MB is rather a large image size!
However, we can do better than this. Whilst Debian's an excellent base for
carrying out compilation and building of packages from source, if you're trying
to run a very slimline service, there are better choices. What we could do is
use a very small Alpine Linux base image for our service, and just copy our
standalone `hello-world` executable into it instead (which is why we statically
linked it).

Multi-stage builds allow you to use one base image as the basis for building all
your code, and another base image to actually run as an application's service.
To do this, we add a few parameters to the `FROM` instructions to give them a
name, and then use the `--from` switches to the `COPY` instruction to copy files
from one image to another. By doing this, we can build our executable in an
image that includes all the tools we need to do so, then copy that executable
into a different, smaller image that will act as our service.

Modify the `Dockerfile.template` initial `FROM` line from:

```Dockerfile
FROM balenalib/%%BALENA_MACHINE_NAME%%-debian:buster
```

to

```Dockerfile
FROM balenalib/%%BALENA_MACHINE_NAME%%-debian:buster as build
```

This informs the builder that all instructions up to the next `FROM`
instruction relate to an image that can be referenced in the same file as
`build`. Now remove the `CMD` line at the end of the file, and add the following
instead:

```Dockerfile
FROM balenalib/%%BALENA_MACHINE_NAME%%-alpine:3.8

# Change workdir and then copy the hello-world executable from the build image
# into this one
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/hello-world ./

# Start the executable!
CMD ["/usr/src/app/hello-world"]
```

We've now defined a second image that will be used as the actual service. The
final image in a Dockerfile, defined by `FROM`, will always be the image used
as the service. As you can see, we copy the compiled executable from the
build image, referenced by the `--from=build` switch, into the final service
image. Finally, the command to run the self-contained executable is made.

Now push the application again with the modified Dockerfile:

```shell

			            ,.-' >.'
			           <.'_.''
			             <'
```

Even though we've changed the initial `FROM` line, you can see that as it's
a build-time reference, the cache was still used for the rest of the steps!

Now wait for the updated application to download and restart. Then SSH into
the device again:

```shell
$ balena ssh 1234567
root@1234567:~# balena images | grep registry2
registry2.balena-cloud.com/v2/9786f6bfe803b9ae6643a54a52123457   <none>              5d0de84fe0f7        2 minutes ago       39.9MB
```

Now our service is only 39.9MB in size, as opposed to the 289MB it was
originally, over seven times smaller!

Using multi-stage builds when building services that need to do their own
packaging and building of components can create a huge space saving that
allows you to add more services than would otherwise be possible.

There's more information on
[multi-stage builds here](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/).

## Conclusion

In this masterclass, you've learned how balena services are defined, both
as single service and multicontainer applications, as well as methodologies
that are associated with them. You should now be confident enough to:

* Create single service and multicontainer applications
* Know the difference between `host` and `bridge` networking and when to use
    them
* Be able to build and run `systemd` in a service
* Know when to use multi-stage builds to decrease a service image's size
