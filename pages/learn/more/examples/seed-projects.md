# Resin.io Seed Projects

## Programming Language Seed Projects

Below is a list of simple 'Hello, World' projects written in a number of
different programming languages, which are designed to form the basis of your
own projects written in each language.

The projects use [Dockerfiles][dockerfile] to install packages and configure the
local environment as needed for each language. This step is performed on the
resin.io build server and the finished product is pushed to your devices.

A link is provided for each project's individual Dockerfile below for easy
customisation.

## Installing a Project

To install a project you will need a [resin.io][resin] account with an
application set up ready to receive code. See the
[getting started][getting-started] and [deployment][deploy] guides for details
on how to do this.

To deploy a project simply clone it and push it to your application's `resin`
endpoint. E.g. for the [Text to Speech Converter project][text2speech]:-

```
git clone https://github.com/resin-io/text2speech.git
git remote add resin [endpoint]
git push resin master
```

### Node.js

[Repository][simple-nodejs]

This is a simple Hello, World project for [node.js][node] designed to act as a
basis for future work. It demonstrates how to install native Linux packages and
configure your application.

[Repository][simple-nodejs-server-link]

This seed project runs a simple [Express.js][expressjs-link] server on port `:80`.
It is slightly different from the simple-nodejs project as it includes a [Dockerfile][resin-dockerfile-guide], this allows for more flexibility at build time and better caching of builds.

### Python

[Repository][hello-python]

Hello World written in [Python][python] using a [custom Dockerfile][python-dockerfile].

[Repository][simple-python-server-link]

This seed project runs a simple [Flask][flask-python-link] server on port `:80`.

### Câ™¯

[Repository][hello-dotnet] by [Martin Calsyn][martincalsyn]

Hello World written in [C#][csharp] using a
[custom Dockerfile][csharp-dockerfile].

Martin is also currently building out a series of [.net][dotnet] resin.io examples, you can view his progress [here][dotnet-lib]

__NOTE:__ This project can be adapted to target any [.net][dotnet] language.

### Java

[Repository][hello-java]

Hello World written in [Java][java] using a
[custom Dockerfile][java-dockerfile].

__NOTE:__ This project can be adapted to target any [JVM][jvm] language.

### Scala

[Repository][hello-scala]

Hello World written in [Scala][scala] using a
[custom Dockerfile][scala-dockerfile]. Uses SBT to fetch the Scala runtime.

### Ruby

[Repository][hello-ruby]

Hello World written in [Ruby][ruby] using a [custom Dockerfile][ruby-dockerfile].

### Golang

[Repository][golang-seed-link]

This is a simple seed project for getting started with Go on the Intel Edison.
The project use [GB][gb-builder-link] to build the project and it's dependencies
in the `Dockerfile`.

__Note:__ This project will not build on any of the ARM architecture board. Currently,
this project will only work on the Intel Edison.

[Resin Golang Image Example][golang-image-link]

This project contains examples of how to use Resin Golang images on devices supported by Resin.io.

### Flogo

You can use Project Flogo to develop IoT edge applications with no code using a graphical development web UI.

This hello world for Flogo helps you to get started.
