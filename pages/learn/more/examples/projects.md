# Projects Built on {{ $names.company.upper }}

## Installing a Project

To install a project you will need a [{{ $names.company.lower }}][resin] account with an
application set up ready to receive code. See the
[getting started][getting-started] and [deployment][deploy] guides for details
on how to do this.

To deploy a project simply clone it and push it to your application's {{ $names.company.lower }}
endpoint. E.g. for the [Text to Speech Converter project][text2speech]:

```
git clone {{ $links.githubMain }}/text2speech.git
git remote add {{ $names.company.short }} [endpoint]
git push {{ $names.company.short }} master
```
