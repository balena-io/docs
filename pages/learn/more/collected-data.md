title: Collected Data

# Data collected by {{ $names.company.lower }}

In order to make data driven decisions, {{ $names.company.lower }} collects usage related events via a 3rd party 
analytics service, [Amplitude][amplitude]. These events provide us context on the state of container execution steps. This 
way we could observe the health of fleets in {{ $names.cloud.lower }} ecosystem and analyze the potential problems as 
well as trends.

## User data collected by {{ $names.company.lower }}

{{ $names.company.lower }} collects information about CLI and web dashboard usage behavior.
User data we process includes

* user name (login) and the email address used to log into the system,
* device type, operating system and browser versions,
* device screen size,
* IP address,
* referrer to {{ $names.company.lower }} sites,
* company user belongs to (when web dashboard is used only).

Please note that {{ $names.company.lower }} does not collect information about end users of devices managed with
{{ $names.company.lower }} platform, i.e. information about our customer users is not collected or processed.
We work only with data collected for users who use {{ $names.company.lower }} to manage their device fleets.

## {{ $names.etcher.lower }}

{{ $names.etcher.lower }} is an application maintained by {{ $names.company.lower }} team that can be used to easily
flash OS images to SD cards and USB drives. If user does not opt out from collecting the analytics data, the application
tracks its usage. In addition to the data described above, information about the type of SD cards and USB drives is
collected too.

## Device data collected by the supervisor

Data are submitted to Amplitude from {{ $names.company.lower }}-managed devices on the events listed in
the table below. Submitted packets [may contain][supervisor-data-mask] the following information:

* Fleet ID and name
* Docker image hash
* Service ID, name, labels
* Release ID and/or git commit hash used to make the release
* Device IP address (as reported in {{ $names.company.lower }} dashboard)
* OS and supervisor versions
* Error root cause message (in case of error events)
* Timing info about device management operations (see event names)

## Data collected automatically by Amplitude
Amplitude library generates a unique identifier for each device that sends an event.
We associate the events with the device UUID provided by {{ $names.cloud.lower }} as well.
Besides these identifiers, we don’t send any other user ID to Amplitude.

Amplitude library automatically extracts geographical location data from the device’s IP address,
so it collects city, region and country information.
See more in a [relevant article by Amplitude][amplitude-auto-collection].

## About logging
Logs produced by the releases deployed to the devices via {{ $names.company.lower }} supervisor application
can be streamed to web dashboard or CLI user who has permissions to view them through our cloud.
However, the logs are stored in the cloud temporarily only in order to allow the streaming
functionality - {{ $names.company.lower }} does not process device application logs unless technical support is
requested by our users.
