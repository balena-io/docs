# Balena Glossary


The glossary is a quick reference tool for important terms, concepts and phrasing used at balena. This includes both balena-specific and general terminology that's commonly used in and across balena.

Is there a word or term that's missing? Does a definition need reworking or further clarity? Additions and improvements to the glossary are encouraged! You can either add these yourself or open a issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/balena-io/docs/issues/new).

> Make sure an entry is comprised of the word / acronym or phrase, whether it's a balena specific term or not, brief description and (when possible) a link to further reading / single source of truth for that definition.


## A

### Apps
**(Apps are not unique to balena, but in this instance it's a reference specific to balena)**
An app is a coherent combination of services (blocks or other software) which will produce something useful for someone, it's ready to be deployed on a device / fleet.

### Assume Positive Intent
As we're a remote first company that communicates asynchronously across keyboards and screen the majority of the time, social cues, context and body language aren't present to help with understanding each other. We try to stick to 'assume positive intent' when trying to understand how we're communicating with each other. E.g. not using an emoji doesn't mean they're annoyed at you.

### AUFS
A union filesystem (allows files and directories of separate file systems to be transparently overlaid forming a single coherent file system). The aufs storage driver is used by balenaEngine, but will be replaced by Overlay2 in the future.

### Deltas
**(balena specific term)** Deltas is a balenaCloud feature that enables users to minimize network bandwidth usage and associated costs when deploying new releases to their fleets, by letting devices download the absolute minimum amount of data. From a technical perspective it works as follows: the *delta server*, a backend component of balenaCloud, computes on-demand the binary difference between the images in the new release and the release the fleet is currently running, and the *Supervisor* on a device applies this difference locally by, effectively, mutating its local images. Under a few conditions, deltas are also generated by the *builder* when it builds a new release.

### Docker image
'A file used to execute code in a Docker container.'

### Deploy with balena aka. DWB
**(balena specific term)**
The ‘Deploy with balena’ button is a feature that allows balenaCloud users to create, and push code to an application, in just a few clicks. It’s an alternative deployment method that provides a shortcut so users don’t have to clone or download code and manually add it to their application. It is as much a feature for project builders as it is for project owners, who can enable others to build their projects by adding a single line of code in their readme, or any other web page, and it will link to their own github repo.
[more](https://www.balena.io/blog/deploy-with-balena-makes-it-easier-to-deploy-and-share-iot-apps/)

## E

## F

### Feedback Loop
'The part of a system in which some portion (or all) of the system's output is used as input for future operations. Each feedback loop has a minimum of four stages. During the first stage, input is created. During the second stage, input is captured and stored. During the third stage, input is analyzed and during the fourth stage, the insight gained from analysis is used to make decisions.' Feedback loops are a core to the way we work at balena as they are fundamental to systems design. 

### Fleet

A group of devices sharing the same releases, variables, configuration, settings and members.

### Fin
**(balena specific term)**

### Fog
The term “fog” attempts to categorize network+compute architectures which flatten in order to distribute computing, storage, and networking closer to end users and sensors. While the term “edge computing / nodes” can often be used in these scenarios, not all “edge compute” can be described by fog terminology, because fog requires the inclusion of network components, and not all edge compute models are network (IP) connected.

### Git server (balena architecture)
**(Git servers are not unique to balena, but in this instance it's a reference specific to balena)**
The balenaCloud-hosted git servers that users may do a “git push” to in order to build their application.  This is more of a legacy feature since we recommend users to do a “balena push” that sends their code directly to the builders.  This is ephemeral and we do not commit to the users any level of persistence for their code.  Users should not use this as a source of truth for their version control system.

### Loop (balena)
**(balena specific team)**
[See *Feedback Loop*](#feedback-loop). At balena, we structure our team as a collection of feedback loops. What we often call "the loop" is our framework for continuously improving products. We also define specific loops at balena that focus on building products for a particular user. Each of these loops puts "the loop" framework into practice to build a product for its users. For example, the teamOS loop uses "the loop" to build and improve the user experience for balena team members. The balena.io product loop uses "the loop" to build and improve the user experience for balena users. etc

### Pattern
**(balena specific term)**
A pattern (or symptom) of behaviour that we've observed, that we feedback into the [loops](#loop-balena). Patterns are observations rather than solutions - For example 'Customer wants the ability to filter device type' is a pattern, as opposed to 'create device filter'. As a pattern receives higher weighting (so, for example, we see more customers experiencing a similar issue or point of friction), or higher urgency signals, its relative importance is raised so that the loop team can see it emerge.

Pine.js is a sophisticated rules-driven API engine that enables you to define rules in a structured subset of English. Those rules are used in order for Pine.js to generate a database schema and the associated OData API. This makes it very easy to rapidly create, update and maintain a backend while keeping the logic in an easily understood form, as well as providing the ability to update and maintain this logic going forward.
[more](https://github.com/balena-io/pinejs)

### Preset

### Semantic versioning aka. Semver
A version number given to a new release. Versions are broken into MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH - depending on which number is changed, conveys what type of change has been made to the code between versions. For example if you are running version 2.0.0, a new version with the number 2.1.0 would signify a minor change has been made.
[more](https://semver.org/)

### Service (balena)
**(Services are not unique to balena, but in this instance it's a reference specific to balena)**
An independently deployable component of an application, packaged into a Docker image and run as a container.

### Slug
'A human-readable, unique identifier'

### Snapback
**(balena specific term)**
When a JellyFish support ticket “snaps back” from Closed state to Open state and reappears in the queue. This action is driven by linking a GitHub issue in the relevant repository to a ticket. When the issue is closed, the snapback is triggered. A support agent then sees the ticket, and can send a message to the affected user to let them know the issue is resolved. Snapback often is used to notify of a requested OS release.

### Social sign-on aka. SSO
Using a social media account to sign up for a platform

### Supervisor aka. SV
**(balena specific term)**

**(balena specific term)**
The testbot is a device used to aid in the automation of hardware testing. It connects to a balena fin through a HAT interface, and provides a mechanism to remotely provision, power, and run a test suite against a device under test (DUT). Testbot’s vision is to completely isolate the DUT when testing it much like an octopus around its prey. We control the power, network type and the image flashed to the DUT.

## U
