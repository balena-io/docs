# Develop locally

Local mode is the development mode for balena. It allows you to build and sync code to a single development device in your local network without having to go through the balenaCloud build service and deployment pipeline. It uses the Docker daemon on the device to build container images and then the supervisor starts the containers in the exact same way as if it were deployed via the cloud.

## Local mode requirements

In order to use local mode on a device:
- The device must be running balenaOS v2.29.0 or higher.
- The device must be running a [development][development] variant of the OS.
- You must have the [balena CLI][cli] installed on your workstation.
- Local mode must be enabled through the dashboard. To use local mode on a development device, click on the small *Actions* dropdown at the top right of the device page and select *Enable Local Mode*.

## Scan the network and find your device

Before you can get any code running, you first have to find your device. To do this, login to the balena CLI and use `balena local scan`. Note, you may need administrator privileges to run the scan as it needs access to all network interfaces.

All balenaOS devices advertise themselves on the network using Avahi. The names take the form `<short-uuid>.local`, where the short-uuid is the uuid you see on your device dashboard. The CLI allows you to scan the network and discover your device:

**Command**
```
sudo balena local scan
```
**Output**
```

## Push over a new project

Now that we know where our device is on the network we can start pushing some code to it. To do this, we use the `balena push` command. This command instructs the device to do a Docker build and then runs your container(s) in the same configuration as the balenaOS device supervisor would. Currently you need to pass the device's IP address as an argument to the command and by default `balena push` will build from the current working directory, but it is also possible to specify the project directory via the `--source` option.

**Command**
```
balena push 192.168.1.37
```
**Output**
```

These containers will have access to all the features and environment that balenaCloud deployed devices have. For example, you will still be able to query and use the [supervisor API][supervisor API] and the containers will be brought up automatically on boot.

## Caveats
- Set device and service environment variables from the dashboard will not be applied to localMode containers, but it is still possible to set these in your `docker-compose.yml` or `Dockerfile`.
- Changes to Device configuration variables, for example `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_gpu_mem`, will result in the device rebooting and applying those settings.
- Actions such as `Restart` and `purge Data` from balenaCloud interface will not apply to localMode containers.
- When switching out of localMode and back to tracking releases from balenaCloud, the balena supervisor will destroy any localMode containers and clean up unneeded base images, and then start up the application that balenaCloud instructs it to run.

## SSH into the running app container or host OS

If we want to run some test commands in our app container, we can do this easily using `{{ $names.company.short }} local ssh`. This command drops us directly into the selected container:
```
sudo {{ $names.company.short }} local ssh f340127.local
```
To connect to the host OS, we can add the `--host` option. From here, we can check system logs and [perform other troubleshooting tasks][troubleshooting]:

```
sudo {{ $names.company.short }} local ssh f340127.local --host
```

## Using a Private Docker Registry

If your project relies on a private base image, then it is possible to specify your registry credentials when doing a `balena push`. To do this you simply pass the `--registry-secrets` option as shown below.

```bash
balena push 192.168.1.37 --registry-secrets /Path/To/File/dockerhub-secret.yml 
```

Where `dockerhub-secret.yml` is a YAML file containing my private registry usernames and passwords to be used by the device balena-engine when pulling base images during a build.

Sample secrets YAML file:

```yaml
'https://index.docker.io/v2/':
  username: johnDoe
  password: myPassword
```
