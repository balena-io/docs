# Interact with hardware

For many projects, you may need to control or have access to some external hardware via interfaces like GPIO, I2C or SPI. For single-container fleets, you will automatically have access to `/dev` and these interfaces as the container is run in [**privileged** mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#/full-container-capabilities-privileged). This means you should be able to use any hardware modules like you would in a vanilla Linux environment.

Multicontainer fleets do not run containers in privileged mode by default. If you want to make use of hardware, you will have to appropriately configure your `docker-compose.yml` file to either set some services to privileged, using `privileged: true`, or use the `cap_add` and `devices` settings to map in the correct hardware access to the container.

As an example, here the `gpio` service is set up to use i2c and serial uart sensors:

```
gpio:
	build: ./gpio
	devices:
	  - "/dev/i2c-1:/dev/i2c-1"
	  - "/dev/mem:/dev/mem"
	  - "/dev/ttyACM0:/dev/ttyACM0"
	cap_add:
	  - SYS_RAWIO
```

__Note:__ If you are not using one of the Docker base images recommended in our [base images wiki][base-image-wiki-link], then it's most likely you will need to handle the updating of `/dev` via [udev][udev-link] yourself.
