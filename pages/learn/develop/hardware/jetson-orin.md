## Checking your Jetson Orin's UEFI firmware version

You can check which UEFI firmware version your Jetson Orin device is running either by connecting to your device's debug UART interface, or by attaching a display to the Orin's video port.

<details>
<summary><b>I want to use the debug UART interface</b></summary>
<br>

<p>If you are using the <b>Jetson Orin Nano Devkit</b>, <b>Jetson Orin NX</b>, the <b>Seeed J3010</b> or <b>Seeed J4010</b> you will need a USB to TTL converter cable. The USB to TTL converter's pins need to be connected to the UART TXD, UART RXD and GND pins on the Jetson carrier board, which are located underneath the Orin module. The other end of the cable should be plugged into the USB port of your host/development PC. Your host PC can connect to the Jetson device using a serial communication program like <code>minicom</code> </p>

![Orin Nano Devkit pinout location](/img/jetson-orin/Nano_pinout_with_module_square.webp)

![Orin Nano Devkit UART pins](/img/jetson-orin/Nano_pinout_close_square.webp)

<p>On <b>Jetson AGX Orin 32GB</b> and <b>Jetson AGX Orin 64GB</b> Devkits, the debug UART interface is available through the micro-USB interface, when the device is powered on. Connect the other end of the micro-usb cable to your host/development PC. If your host is running Linux, the serial connection to the Jetson device can be accessed using <code>minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0</code>.</p>

![AGX Orin microUSB debug port](/img/jetson-orin/AGX_Orin_DP_microUSB_square.webp)

<p>If you are using the UART interface, the UEFI firmware version will be printed in the boot sequence logs:</p>

![Orin UEFI uart logs](/img/jetson-orin/jetson_orin_uefi_version_uart_logs.webp)

<p>Alternatively, if booting is stopped in the UEFI menu by pressing <code>Esc</code>, the firmware version will be printed in the top-left corner:</p>

If a display is connected to the device, the firmware update process will also be rendered on the screen:

![Orin UEFI firmware update progress](/img/jetson-orin/jetson_orin_uefi_firmware_update.webp)


## Alternative provisioning options

By default, most Jetson Orin devices need an internal storage media and a USB Flash Drive or tool in order to be provisioned. If your device is an Orin Nano or Orin NX, an NVMe drive has to be attached to the
carrier board before starting the provisioning process. The AGX Orin 32GB and 64GB Devkits have a built-in eMMC which is used by default for provisioning balenaOS.

Select devices allow using other internal or external storage mediums for provisioning. Pick your device below to see the available provisioning options:

<details>
<summary><b>Jetson AGX Orin 32GB Devkit</b></summary>

Currently, the Jetson AGX Orin 32GB can be provisioned with balenaOS on the eMMC only, by using the <a href="https://github.com/balena-os/jetson-flash">Jetson Flash</a> tool.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Jetson AGX Orin 64GB Devkit</b></summary>

The default internal storage used for provisioning balenaOS is the AGX Orin 64GB's on-board eMMC.

  - If you would like to use a USB key to flash an NVME drive attached to your Jetson AGX Orin 64GB instead of the on-board eMMC, use the [installer.target_devices][installer.target_devices] configuration option in the flasher USB key's [config.json][config_json] to specify the NVME as target medium:

  ```json
  "installer": {
      "target_devices":"nvme0n1"
  }
  ```

  - If you would like the same USB Key or NVMe on which the balenaOS flasher image has been written to be used as both install and boot media, use both the [installer.migrate][installer.migrate] and [installer.target_devices][installer.target_devices] configuration options:
  ```json
  "installer": {
      "migrate": {
        "force": true
      },
      "target_devices":"sda nvme0n1"
  }
  ```

  The first medium found in the `target_devices` list will be used for provisioning and it will become the main storage of your device once flashing is complete.

  Available target devices are:
    - <code>mmcblk0</code> - on-board eMMC. Unless overriden, this is the default for the AGX Orin Devkit 64GB
    - <code>sda</code> - removable drives like USB flash keys or SSDs
    - <code>nvme0n1</code> - NVMe drive

  <details>
  <summary><b>How do I set this configuration in my balenaOS image?</b></summary>

  6) Write the balenaOS image (balena.img) to your SD-CARD, USB flash drive or NVMe. We recommend using <a href="https://etcher.balena.io">Etcher</a>.

  7) Ensure the power cable is disconnected from the Orin Nano Devkit.

  8) Insert the freshly flashed SD-CARD, USB key or NVMe drive into the Devkit and connect its' power cable.

  9) Once provisioning is complete, the board will perform one of the following actions:
     - restart and boot balenaOS automatically, if [installer.migrate.force][installer.migrate] has been set in [config.json][config_json].
     - shut down if [installer.migrate.force][installer.migrate] has not been set in [config.json][config_json]. Unplug the external flasher medium and then remove and re-connect the power cable to the Devkit.

  10) Your device should appear in your application dashboard within a few minutes.

  - If you would like to use a USB flash drive an NVME drive attached to your device, simply insert the USB flash drive and connect power to the board.

  - If you would like the same USB Key or NVMe on which the balenaOS flasher image has been written to be used as both install and boot media, use both the [installer.migrate][installer.migrate] and [installer.target_devices][installer.target_devices] configuration options:

  ```json
  "installer": {
      "migrate": {
        "force": true
      },
      "target_devices":"sda nvme0n1"
  }
  ```

  The first medium found in the `target_devices` list will be used and it will become the main storage of your device once flashing is complete.

  Available target devices are:
    - <code>sda</code> - removable drives like USB flash keys or SSDs
    - <code>nvme0n1</code> - NVMe drive. Unless overriden, this option is the default for your device

  <summary><b>How do I set this configuration in my balenaOS image?</b></summary>

  1) Make sure you have <a href="https://jqlang.org/download/">jq</a> and the <a href="https://docs.balena.io/reference/balena-cli/latest/">balena CLI</a> installed on your host/development PC. You can obtain it from <a href="https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md">here</a>.

  2) Download the balenaOS image from the balenaCloud dashboard or use the balena CLI to obtain one. Use the <a href="https://docs.balena.io/reference/hardware/devices/">balena device type list</a> to obtain the device-type SLUG (machine name).
  
  ```shell
  balena os download <device-type slug> -o balena.img
  ```
  
  3) Download a configuration file from your balenaCloud dashboard or generate a new one using the balena CLI:
  
  ```shell
  balena config generate --fleet balena_cloud_org/balena_cloud_fleet --version 6.4.0 --network ethernet --appUpdatePollInterval 10 --output config.json
  ```
  Replace <code>balena_cloud_org</code> and <code>balena_cloud_fleet</code> with your actual balena cloud organization and fleet.

  4) Depending your desired provisioning setup, set one or more of the available installer options:
  
  ```shell
  tmp=$(mktemp)
  jq '.installer.migrate.force |= true' config.json > ${tmp}
  mv ${tmp} config.json
  ```
  
  ```shell
  tmp=$(mktemp)
  jq '.installer.target_devices |= "sda nvme0n1"' config.json > ${tmp}
  mv ${tmp} config.json
  ```
  
  5) Use the balena CLI to inject the modified configuration file in the newly downloaded image:
  ```shell
  sudo balena config inject config.json -d balena.img
  ```

  6) Write the balenaOS image (balena.img) to your USB flash drive or NVMe. We recommend using <a href="https://etcher.balena.io">Etcher</a>.

  7) Ensure the power cable is disconnected from your device.

  8) Insert the freshly flashed SD-CARD, USB key or NVMe drive into the carrier board and connect its' power cable.

  9) Once provisioning is complete, the board will perform one of the following actions:
     - restart and boot balenaOS automatically, if [installer.migrate.force][installer.migrate] has been set in [config.json][config_json].
     - shut down if [installer.migrate.force][installer.migrate] has not been set in [config.json][config_json]. Unplug the external flasher medium and then remove and re-connect the power cable to the carrier board.

  10) Your device should appear in your application dashboard within a few minutes.
