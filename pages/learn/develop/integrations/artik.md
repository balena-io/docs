# Samsung ARTIK Cloud integration

The [Samsung ARTIK Cloud](https://artik.cloud/) is an open data exchange platform for the Internet of Things (IoT). It uses APIs for devices and services to interact with each other, to send, receive, and analyze data. This tutorial shows how to use ARTIK Cloud with devices deployed on {{ $names.company.lower }}.

As a simple illustration use case, an example device is used which reads local ambient temperatures, and send the readings to the ARTIK Cloud for logging and analysis.

## Configuring Artik Cloud

You need to create a Samsung account to [sign up](https://artik.cloud/account/signup) for the ARTIK Cloud. If you already have an account you can [log in](https://artik.cloud/account/login) to the portal.

ARTIK Cloud has two main dashboards. The [developers dashboard](https://developer.artik.cloud/dashboard) provides an interface to create and manage device types and applications. [My ARTIK Cloud](https://artik.cloud/my) allows management of devices, data, and automated actions.

### Device type creation

The first step is creating a new device type, which specifies  what kind of data can be sent send and what actions can be taken by actual devices deployed under this type. For example if a networked air conditioning system might send temperature measurements to the platform, and can turn a cooler unit on/off, this information would be set up as a device type, and all units of the system would be deployed on ARTIK Cloud following this device type.

To create your first device type, on the developer dashboard navigate to device types, and [create new device](https://developer.artik.cloud/dashboard/devicetypes/new), as it is shown on the following screenshot:

![New ARTIK Cloud device type](/img/integrations/artik/ARTIKCloud_new_devicetype.png)

Set a suitable _display name_, and a _unique name_ for the device type. In my example the display name is "My {{ $names.company.upper }} Device", and the unique name is `my.{{ $names.company.lower }}.v1`. Unique names can, but do not have to follow the pattern of reversed Internet domain name format, for example `io.{{ $names.company.lower }}.aircon`.

After the new device type is created, you have to declare its capabilities through a manifest file. A manifest file is a specially formatted JSON file (see the [documentation](https://developer.artik.cloud/documentation/introduction/the-manifest.html)), which can be either manually created, or you can use the online manifest creator from the device type's dashboard:

![Device type manifest](/img/integrations/artik/ARTIKCloud_manifest.png)

There are two main tabs on the manifest creator, one is for Device Fields, and one is for Device Actions. Device Fields describe what kind of data the ARTIK Cloud may receive from the device (in form of "messages"), while Device Actions describe what kind of data the ARTIK Cloud may send to the device (in form of "actions").

Device Fields can be any kind of data: numbers, boolean values, strings, arrays of values. There are a number of other settings you can define for any data field, such as default units, description, use tags for later easy filtering of data groups, or can define field groups.

In this example above, a single data field is set, `Temperature`, with `Double` data type, default units of `℃`, a description, and some tags. If instead of using the online editor, you would want to upload a manifest file, the following is the equivalent setting:

```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "Temperature",
      "type": "CUSTOM",
      "valueClass": "Double",
      "isCollection": false,
      "description": "Ambient temperature measurement",
      "tags": [
        "environment",
        "temperature"
      ],
      "unitSymbol": "℃"
    }
  ],
  "messageFormat": "json"
}
```

I've got this file by exporting the manifest from the device type dashboard, once it is set up. This way you can save and use version control on your manifest files as well.

The next step would be adding any actions that the device can take, but that is out of scope for this simple getting started tutorial and we won't add any actions. As a general overview, actions have a "name" which is equivalent of a command sent to the device (e.g. "setText" to display a given text any way the device is capable of, or "turnOff" to turn off the the device). The actions may also have parameters (but don't have to), which act as arguments to the command (such as the "text" parameter of the "setText" action, to tell the device what to display). ARTIK Cloud has a number of default actions, but you can define any action name, and any parameter names.

For more advanced set up, you can consult the [device manifest documentation](https://developer.artik.cloud/documentation/data-management/the-manifest.html).

Once data fields and actions are set up, save and activate the manifest. Your new device type is ready to use:

![Device type set up](/img/integrations/artik/ARTIKCloud_devicetype_done.png)

There are advanced options available on that dashboard to manage the device type, for example setting the visibility of the device type, whether or not others on the ARTIK Cloud may discover and use it, updating the manifest, and checking error logs.

### Device creation

Next, we need to create a new device with the above device type. This is done on the [My ARTIK Cloud dashboard](https://www.artik.cloud/my). When prompted to connect your first device, in the device type field you will be able to find the name, in this example "My {{ $names.company.upper }} Device". You can use any convenient name for your device itself.

![New device](/img/integrations/artik/ARTIKCloud_new_device.png)

Once you save the settings, the dashboard will list the new device. Select the cog icon on device's tab, to bring up its settings:

![Device token](/img/integrations/artik/ARTIKCloud_device_token.png)

One important information to note is the Device ID, needed to authenticate with the actual device to the platform. The second piece of information required is the Device Token, generated on the same tab. Device Tokens can be revoked from the same tab if required.

If you are planning to connect multiple physical devices to this application, you'll need to repeat these device creation steps for each of them.

### Rules and Actions

Actions are generally sent to the devices either by other devices, or through the rules set up either through the API, or the [Rules dashboard](https://artik.cloud/my/rules). The rules can be triggered by either values received by the ARTIK Cloud from the devices in messages, or scheduled by time. The output of the rules can be actions sent to devices, or emails sent to a given address.

![Rules dashboard](/img/integrations/artik/ARTIKCloud_rules.png)

One useful trick while developing actions is setting up your rule as a scheduled action, save it, then in the rules dashboard trigger it by the corresponding "test" button. Continue developing your application, and once the action is processed correctly, edit the action and set the device activity (i.e. reading value) you would like the action to be triggered by (if needed). The trick is used because only scheduled actions can be manually triggered at the moment.

For more information see the [Develop Rules for Devices](https://developer.artik.cloud/documentation/connect-the-data/develop-rules-for-devices.html) section of the ARTIK Cloud documentation.

## Configuring {{ $names.company.upper }}

Go to your [{{ $names.company.lower }} dashboard]({{ $links.dashboardUrl }}/) and create a new application with the physical device type you are using (for example a Samsung ARTIK board, or any other). In the tutorial's example a BeagleBone Green Wifi is used (with a temperature sensor module).

In the application dashboard define two application-wide environmental variables for the Device ID and Device Token values. For clarity you can choose `ARTIKCLOUD_DEVICE_ID` `ARTIKCLOUD_DEVICE_TOKEN`, though can use any other value you like. In the application-wide setting just use a placeholder value, such as `REDEFINE`.

![Environment variables](/img/integrations/artik/ARTIKCloud_environment.png)

Set up your device and connect to {{ $names.company.lower }}. Then in the device's dashboard, redefine the environmental variables (the Device ID and Device Token) saved from the previous step. If you have multiple devices, do these steps for all of them.

After this, the credentials for the devices to talk to ARTIK Cloud will be available from within your application code as environmental variables!

## Programming

There are multiple ways to connect to the ARTIK Cloud to send and receive data, including WebSockets, MQTT, CoAP, REST (see the [API reference](https://developer.artik.cloud/documentation/api-reference/)), and there are also a number of [native SDKs](https://developer.artik.cloud/documentation/tools/native-sdks.html) that you can speed things up with. For most applications on {{ $names.company.lower }} the [Python](https://github.com/artikcloud/artikcloud-python) or the [Javascript/Node.js](https://github.com/artikcloud/artikcloud-js) SDK are the simplest to start with, though they can only send message at this time. In case you are both sending messages and receiving actions, we recommend using WebSockets or MQTT. The following section highlights some language-specific notes for using {{ $names.company.lower }} and ARTIK Cloud. For more detailed information see the rest of the docs, and be sure to check out the SDKs documentation.

### Python

#### Using the ARTIK Cloud Python SDK

Here are a few notes using the [Python SDK](https://github.com/artikcloud/artikcloud-python) with {{ $names.company.lower }} devices. Using [Dockerfile templates](/deployment/docker-templates/), start from the {{ $names.company.lower }} default Python images, for example:

```
FROM {{ $names.base.lib }}/%%{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_MACHINE_NAME%%-python:2.7
```

Add the `artikcloud` dependency in your `requirements.txt` file:

```
# Uncomment to use latest released version
artikcloud
# Uncomment to use latest development version from GitHub
#-e git+https://github.com/artikcloud/artikcloud-python.git#egg=artikcloud
```

Later in your `Dockerfile.template` you can then install it as:

```
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

Then in your application you can access the environmental variables through `os.getenv(VARIABLE)`, and send messages through the SDK. A very simple example is as follows:

```python
import os
import time
import artikcloud
from artikcloud.rest import ApiException

# Setting credentials from the environmental variables
DEVICE_ID = os.getenv('ARTIKCLOUD_DEVICE_ID')
DEVICE_TOKEN = os.getenv('ARTIKCLOUD_DEVICE_TOKEN')

# Setting up ARTIK Cloud connection
api_client = artikcloud.ApiClient()
# Setting up ARTIK Cloud connection
artikcloud.configuration.access_token = DEVICE_TOKEN
# Setting up messaging
messages_api = artikcloud.MessagesApi()

# Send a new message
message = artikcloud.Message()
message.type = "message"
message.sdid = "{}".format(DEVICE_ID)
message.ts = int(round(time.time() * 1000))  # timestamp, required
message.data = {'Temperature': 25.4}
response = messages_api.send_message_action(message)
print(response)
```

#### Using WebSockets from Pyton

You can use any Python WebSockets library to communicate with the ARTIK Cloud. Check the [WebSockets connection](https://developer.artik.cloud/documentation/connect-the-data/rest-and-websockets.html) and [WebSockets API](https://developer.artik.cloud/documentation/api-reference/websockets-api.html) pages on the ARTIK Cloud Documentation.

The [artilcloud-resin-python]({{ $links.githubProjects }}/artikcloud-resin-python) project includes a example of how to connect to the ARTIK Cloud using WebSockets, send messages and receive actions.

#### Using MQTT from Python

The [artilcloud-resin-python]({{ $links.githubProjects }}/artikcloud-resin-python) project includes an example of how to connect to the ARTIK Cloud using MQTT, send messages and receive actions.

You can use any Python MQTT library to communicate with the ARTIK Cloud. Check the [MQTT connection](https://developer.artik.cloud/documentation/connect-the-data/mqtt.html) and [MQTT API](https://developer.artik.cloud/documentation/api-reference/mqtt-api.html) pages on the ARTIK Cloud Documentation.

### Node.js

#### Using the ARTIK Cloud Node.js SDK

Here are a few notes using the [Javascript/Node.js SDK](https://github.com/artikcloud/artikcloud-js) with {{ $names.company.lower }} devices. Using [Dockerfile templates](/deployment/docker-templates/), start from the {{ $names.company.lower }} default Node.js images, for example:

```
FROM {{ $names.base.lib }}/%%{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_MACHINE_NAME%%-node:latest
```

Add the `artikcloud-js` dependency in your `package.json` in your application's folder:

```
npm install artikcloud-js --save
```

Later in your `Dockerfile.template` you can then configure the node modules installation as:

```
COPY package.json ./
RUN JOBS=MAX npm i --unsafe-perm --production && npm cache clean
```

Then in your application you can access the environmental variables through `process.env.VARIABLE`, and send messages through the SDK. A very simple example is as follows:

```javascript
var ArtikCloud = require('artikcloud-js');

// Setting credentials from environmental variables
const device_id = process.env.ARTIKCLOUD_DEVICE_ID || null; // Required
const device_token = process.env.ARTIKCLOUD_DEVICE_TOKEN || null; // Required

var defaultClient = ArtikCloud.ApiClient.default;

// Setting up authentication
var artikcloud_oauth = defaultClient.authentications['artikcloud_oauth'];
artikcloud_oauth.accessToken = device_token;

// Get a new MessagesAPI connection
var messagesAPI = new ArtikCloud.MessagesApi()

// Create a new message
var message = new ArtikCloud.Message();
message.sdid = device_id;
message.type = 'message';
message.ts = Date.now();  // timestamp, required
message.data = { "Temperature": 25.4  };

// Send message
messagesAPI.sendMessage(message, function(error, response) {
    if (error) {
        throw error;
    } else {
        console.log(response);
    }
});
```

## Further information

Once your code is deployed and data is sent succcessfully from your devices to the ARTIK Cloud, you can visualize [your data](https://artik.cloud/my/data):

![Data log](/img/integrations/artik/ARTIKCloud_temperature.png)

Once it is working, you can go to more advanced features, such as [setting rules](https://artik.cloud/my/rules) to act on the data received, or you [exporting](https://artik.cloud/my/exports) your data log.
