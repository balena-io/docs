# Welcome

[{{ $names.company.upper }}][balena] makes it easy to deploy code to fleets of connected devices, bringing the power of Linux containers to the edge. We've optimized the cloud paradigm for remote devices, taking familiar container workflows and custom building for low overhead, high reliability, and out-of-the-box support across a wide variety of devices. With a few simple commands, you can monitor, manage, and update your fleet from anywhere.

Our [{{ $names.company.lower }} primer][primer] covers the platform from end to end, walking through all the pieces and how they fit together. We've also defined some [core concepts][concepts] you'll see throughout the documentation.

Ready to dive in? The [getting started guides][getting-started] take you step-by-step through provisioning your first device and deploying your first application.

Once you're up on the basics, we've got all the info you need to build even the most advanced applications and manage larger fleets:

### [Develop][develop]

As you develop your application, these guides will help you configure and package your services, ensuring you have the proper container setup and that you can interact with hardware and system resources.

### [Deploy][deploy]

When you're ready to bring your application from one to device to a fleet, read up on the basics of the {{ $names.company.lower }} build pipeline, as well as some advanced features to make your code deploys smaller, faster, and more reliable.

### [Manage][manage]

Check here for details on all the tools we provide for managing your device fleet, including configuration variables, service variables, SSH access, and device logs.
