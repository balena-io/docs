# Configure a SAML app for Google Workspace

This guide will walk you through the steps to create a SAML Identity Provider (IdP) using Google Workspace to integrate with balenaCloud. At the end of this guide, you can start using Single Sign-On functionality from your IdP in balenaCloud.

## Prerequisites

1. Access to a Google Workspace admin account capable of creating apps and users for the organization.

## Steps

1.	Access the Google Admin Console
    * Go to [Google Admin Console Apps](https://admin.google.com/ac/apps/unified) using your Google Workspace admin account.

2.	Create a New Custom SAML App
    * Click on Add app.
    * Select Add custom SAML app.

3.	Configure the SAML App
    * Name Your App: Provide a meaningful name for the SAML app (e.g., “balenaCloud SSO”).
    * Download the Metadata: After naming your app, download the metadata file provided by Google. This file will be used later to set up the IdP in balenaCloud.

4.	Set Up Service Provider Details

    * ACS URL: Fill in the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL with:

    ```
    https://api.balena-cloud.com/auth/saml/acme/callback
    ```

    Replace `acme` with the name you will give your IdP in balenaCloud.

    * Entity ID: Fill in the Entity ID with:

    ```
    https://api.balena-cloud.com/auth/saml/acme
    ```

    Again, replace `acme` with the name you will give your IdP.

5.	Skip Attribute Mapping
    * Ignore any mapping configuration. Currently, balenaCloud does not make use of these mappings.

6.	Enable the SAML App
    * In the Service Status section, ensure the new SAML app is set to `ON` for everyone or specific groups. This will those users in your organization access to login to balenaCloud via SSO.

7. Finally, you should a custom SAML app in your Google Workspace that looks similar to this

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You should now have your Identity Provider (IdP) setup, head over to the balenaCloud dashboard and follow the [instructions to link an IdP](/learn/accounts/enterprise-sso/#link-a-saml-identity-provider) by uploading the XML metadata file. Your team can then start using the Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality, allowing them to securely and seamlessly access the platform using their enterprise credentials.
