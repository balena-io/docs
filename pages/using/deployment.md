# Deployment Guide

## Basics

In order to deploy code to your devices you must first ensure they are correctly
connected to a resin.io application. See the
[Getting Started Guide][getting-started] for details.

Then simply add your resin.io endpoint to your [git][git] repository via `git
remote add resin [application endpoint]`.

Whenever you subsequently need to push code to your devices, simply run
`git push resin master`.

## Configuration

### Node Applications

Resin.io supports [node.js][node] natively using the [package.json][package]
file located in the root of the repository to determine how to build and execute
node applications.

When you push your code to your application's git endpoint the deploy server
generates a [container][container] for the environment your device operates in,
deploys your code to it and runs `npm install` to resolve [npm][npm]
dependencies, reporting progress to your terminal as it goes.

If the build executes successfully the container is shipped over to your device
where the supervisor runs it in place of any previously running containers,
using `npm start` to execute your code (note that if no start script is
specified, it defaults to running `node server.js`.)

#### Node.js Example

A good example of this is the [text-to-speech][text-to-speech] application -
here's its `package.json` file*:-

```
{
  "name": "resin-text2speech",
  "description": "Simple resin app that uses Google's TTS endpoint",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/resin-io/text2speech.git"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "preinstall": "bash deps.sh"
  },
  "version": "0.0.3",
  "dependencies": {
    "speaker": "~0.0.10",
    "request": "~2.22.0",
    "lame": "~1.0.2"
  },
  "engines": {
      "node": "0.10.22"
  }
}
```

__Note:__ We don't specify a `start` script here which means node will default
to running `server.js`.

We execute a bash script called `deps.sh` before `npm install` tries to satisfy
the code's dependencies. Let's have a look at that:-

```
apt-get install -y alsa-utils libasound2-dev
mv sound_start /usr/bin/sound_start
```

These are shell commands that are run within the container on the build server
which are configured such that dependencies are resolved for the target
architecture not the build server's - this can be very useful for deploying
[non-js][non-js] code or fulfilling package dependencies that your node code
might require.

We use [Raspbian][raspbian] as our contained operating system, so this scripts
uses [aptitude][aptitude] to install native packages before moving a script for
our node code to use over to `/usr/bin` (the install scripts runs with root
privileges within the container.)

__Note:__ With plain Node.js project, our build server will automatically detect the specified node version in `package.json` file and build the container based on Docker image with satisfied node version installed. the default node version is `0.10.22` and it will be used if node version is not specified. There will be error if specified node version does not exist in our registry and you can try another version or contact us to be supported. More details about Docker node images in our registry can be found [here][resin-base-image] and [here][resin-image-trees]

### Dockerfile Deployment

See the [Dockerfile][dockerfile] guide for custom application deployment using
[Dockerfile][docker-dockerfile]s. This allows you to completely control the
Linux environment you deploy to your devices and write your application in
whatever programming language you prefer.

## The Build Server

The build server is an incredibly powerful tool which cross-compiles code for
the target device on our (far more powerful) server. This gives you the ability
to compile a gnarly dependency tree in seconds on the server rather than minutes
or even hours to build on your device.

All code that is pushed to your resin.io devices is sent to the build server
which builds it, then ships the resultant environment to your devices.
