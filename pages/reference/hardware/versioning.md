## Device Types
A device type in balena describes a [SoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip) or group of SoCs that have the same boot configuration and are capable of booting the same Operating system. When a new device type is created, it is usually because the SoC or configuration is distinctly different from others that exist.

As an example the [Raspberry Pi 1 model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-1-model-b-plus/) and [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) are part of the same device type since they are both `armv6l` architecture SoCs and the boot loader is capable of booting both boards. However, the [Raspberry Pi 3 model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) is by default a `armv7l` CPU and we therefore separate it into a new device type.

In balenaCloud the device type is also used to define what architecture containers are built for. So in the above example, Raspberry Pi Zero deployments are built for the `armv6l` architecture whereas Raspberry Pi 3 fleets will target the `armv7l` architecture, and the Intel NUC device type will target `x86_64` architecture.

### Designations

When looking at all the supported device types in balenaCloud, you will notice that there are a number of different designations. Here we will discuss a few of these designations in more detail.

#### Official
All device types that are not designated with `PRIVATE` are considered officially supported boards.

Official device types are:
- Run through a full suite of testing on real hardware each time an OS version is released for the device type.
- We endevour to ensure that all the hardware peripherals on the device type are functional and accessible. This includes things like i2c, SPI, audio, etc.
- Continually updated to new versions of the OS, usually within 2 or 3 minor versions of meta-balena master version.
- Official devices are recommended for production deployments.


#### Private
Private device types have exactly the same guarantees and testing process as official device types but they are only visible to specific customers that have paid for this device support. If you are interested in finding out more about private device support email solutions@balena.io .


#### Discontinued
Discontinued device types are those that are no longer actively maintained by the balena team.

This means that:

- No new OS releases will be published for that device type.
- The device type will stop showing in the dashboard as options for new fleets and devices. 
- Any already provisioned devices of this type will continue to function, but will no longer receive operating system updates.

##### Why do we discontinue device types

There is a maintenance cost associated with maintaining a device type. It requires engineering, CI and testing resources. We are able to maintain a core set of device types to a higher standard if we focus our efforts on a core set of device types relevant to our users, and that recieve support from the hardware vendors. 

##### Criteria for discontinuation

A device type will be discontinued based on a set of criteria detailed below, in combination with the judgement of our team:
- The device manufacturer ends support and sale of the device. This includes discontinuation of sales, as well as BSP support. This would be grounds for immediate discontinuation. 
- The device type has been on the platform for at least 2 years, with little to no usage. Rougly around 100 devices is the current minimum requirement
- In combination with the above, the device type is not part of any strategic goals at balena.
- No direct forcasted growth for the device type.
- If it is a private device type and the customer has stopped paying for the device to be supported.

## Versioning

The version string for a particular device type is a combination of the [meta-balena]({{ $links.githubOS }}/meta-balena) version and the device specific repo revisions.

* The version of `meta-balena` is in the format of 3 numbers separated by a dot. The patch number can have a `beta` label. e.g. 1.2.3, 1.2.3-beta1, 2.0.0-beta1.
* The version of the specific device type is constructed by appending to the `meta-balena` version a `rev` label. This will have the semantics of a board revision which adapts a specific `meta-balena` version for a targeted board. For example a `meta-balena` 1.2.3 can go through 3 board revisions at the end of which the final version will be 1.2.3+rev3 .
* When updating `meta-balena` version in a specific device type repo, the revision will reset to 1. Ex: 1.2.3+rev4 will be updated to 1.2.4+rev1 .
* Note that the final OS version is NOT based on the semver specification so parsing of such a version needs to be handled in a custom way. If you are interested in how to parse the version scheme, have a look at our balenaOS version parser [balena-semver](https://github.com/balena-io-modules/resin-semver).
